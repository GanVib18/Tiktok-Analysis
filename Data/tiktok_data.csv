Definitely. That was like the biggest first moment of just like FOMO. Sitting there watching it being like the moments of calling them on stage and the excitement. But I really think looking at this shit, like given that all year, this is the first moment, the excitement, the calling, the names, opposing, the little like competitive edge you have on that, that's what I missed because I love that so much. But a couple weeks ago when I saw Ryan, Terry, suffering, dieting all these people, I'm like, I do not miss that. And if you don't enjoy the journey towards the end goal, all you want is the end goal. Hey, you're not gonna work as hard to get there, you're not gonna enjoy it. There's just no point. I'd be so much more likely to like let the gas off on so many areas, potentially not even cause I wasn't putting in my effort in. It was definitely the right decision I had to make to leave. But it's still sad cause I fucking love bodybuilding. Like the moments on stage, that first moment all year to stepping on stage, like nothing beats that. Just excitement, nerves, anxiety, stress. And then as it goes and their confidence builds as you're up there, it's just such a cool feeling. And like the competitive nature, not many people get to compete at something at a high level. Something that I will always cherish. And always miss and always grieve. To some extent. That's life, you know. You can't hold on to the most beautiful things forever. Life is impermanent.",23600000

It's even crazier to have my picture up right now. The last decade of my life has been dedicated to just this and, like, those moments of just excitement and nerves and leading towards something, and now I'm not doing it and, like, understanding that nothing will ever, like, replace the feeling that came from this. Remembering my family up in the crowd, up in the seats up here, just screaming and cheering and pointing at them, giving them the heart, and retiring on this literal stage last year. It's a picture they have up. There's literally me walking out after announcing my retirement. Been like, peace out. I'm done with bodybuilding. Just thinking about, like, how sad it is to walk away from something is such, like, a contrast of perception. Like, there's so much sadness in leaving something, but also so much gratitude to have love something so much that when I walk away from it, it, like, was like, the grieving of a sport. And I feel like one of the things I'm so grateful for was an opportunity for something that I loved and was passionate about, where I had, like, an opportunity to work so hard for something. Like, not many people, I believe, in their life, are lucky enough to have something that they can walk away from. Like, I spent a decade putting Everything I had to being the best at something, whether or not you win or not, to see out your potential and a singular goal. It's something that I will be able to hold on to for the rest of my life. Being like, I gave everything I had and I did what I could to that thing, and I ended up being the best in the world. It's really more so understanding, but we all wanna find our life's purpose and where we're meant to be. And all these things that I felt like, I felt like for the first half of my life at least, there was nowhere else that I was meant to be than on this Olympia stage. Thinking about the amount of relationships I built in my life, in the amount of moments. Annie stressing about not having potatoes. Courtney cooking me all this stuff in the thing. Kelvin running around like crazy. Carly snapping pictures, anxious about all the stuff that are coming. My mom fucking after five minutes of pre judging, losing her voice. Melissa just crying all the time and locked in. Ian, just like, you got this. Getting off stage, texting. Ian be like, how do I look? All those little moments with all the relationships I've built here are so incredible. And I think one of the things that makes me the most sad is, like, being able to celebrate victories with people you love. Comes most when it's like, Something you poured everything into",23600000

It's funny, the way my mind works is like a sense of cope. I'm like, I know it's gonna be hard, but I don't know what's gonna come. And I think what I thought I was going to miss was, like, being mr. Olympia, getting on stage, prep, all the things in between. But one of the moments where it hit me really hard, and I'm not even proud to admit this, is that I went on Instagram and I looked at my followers and it was like, last month you decreased 10,000. And I was like, oh, I've had this feeling in my body that I didn't like that. I've told myself for a decade that I don't give a fuck about that, but it's easy to say when it's just constant skyrocket up, like, I don't care about the success, I'm not attached to this. And all of a sudden, it was like, not there. It just made me really go inside and be like, what? What was I doing it for? What did I really care about? What was like, the have to. Is that I had to do it to be good enough. Was it because of the attention and all the stuff? Before it was like, the love of the sport, it was love of bodybuilding. And then it became this attachment to this, like, need of, like, what came With it all those stuff are incredible. Don't get me wrong, it's not like my don't value having money and attention. Like I'm human, I enjoy it. But it's not what was making me feel good day today. It was taking away from my ability to be at home and I would be like, I have to eat again. I missed a meal, I came to an event, I lost a pound. Are my legs big enough this year? I feel like my waist got bigger. Like, am I gonna be good enough to be the best in the world? That pulls you away from being present in your day to day life cause you're constantly worrying about that. And that's because I became more attached to the outcome than just the love of the game.",23600000

I would say by genuinely knowing and believing that I'm living up to what my most important values are. For example, if I wanna be a good father, if I know I'm showing up as being a good father, that's my value, that's within my control, then I feel good. But the difference of that of like, oh, I want my daughter to love me or be happy with me, or whatever it might be, something like that, is out of your control in the moment. And those are what I would worry for, where if my daughter looked at me, she's like, I hate you, dad, which probably will inevitably happen at some point. And then my self worth is attached to her not hating me. So then I have a crumble and I believe it, and then I act in a certain way rather than being able to dissociate with that and be like, what are my values? Being a good dad. Am I being a good dad? Yeah. Yes, I know I have been being a good dad myself. Worth isn't attached her not saying she hates me. It's in how I know I show up. Hmm. And in believing in my character and who I'm being. So when she says, I hate you, dad, I can not react to that and be able to be like, something's going on with her. What is she experiencing? And I don't have to have the selfish response of, well, I need to get her to love me now. It's like, no, she's hurting right now. Let me be there for her. I mean, that's the double cheat code of being a good dad and having controlled self worth, but learning to learn what your values are and live by them in a way that they're within your control. Hmm.",23600000

It's tough to answer because of my injury I had this year, it was holding on, like, real good until I had like, the shoulder surgery, and then I took three months off training. And in the midst of that, I'm like, I'm gonna do a 80 hour fast because I have never been able to do this as a bodybuilder, and it's great for my health. I lost like eight pounds doing that alone. At that point, I lost about 25 pounds of muscle, which it was drastic on my physique, but then it bounced back quick, too. I think muscle memory is absolutely insane. I think it's harder than people realize to really lose that muscle. Obviously there's the PED side of things, and I'm not doing that shit anymore. I'm still on TRT. Because once you run that kind of stuff, you kind of need to, which is the dangers of doing at a young age. Uh huh. But it's life.

Why does Chris do chest press with his elbows tucked all the time? Generally speaking, he's doing that right now because that variation is gonna be safest for the shoulder and it's gonna be best long term for strength development. They're all fine, but generally, especially nowadays, we spend a lot of time like this, and so it starts to reshape all the fascial lines for everything's internally rotated and pronated. We want to open you up as much as we can. If you can go neutral, if you can keep the elbows just a little bit closer for a little bit more of a range, it just changes the stimulus a little bit. You think I'll get just as strong in that form as I was with my shoulders abducted? You will get stronger because of the fact that one of the limiting factors to you getting stronger than you were before is how long can we go without getting an injury? Yeah.",23600000

I pretty much overdosed on a natural supplement. I took a neurotic product. It was a sample. Not our manufacturer, not our product. I was the only one who took it. But it was supposed to be four pills. I took eight, which I didn't think should have been that big of a deal. Went on with my day. Worked out. I'm sitting, I got flush red. I went outside to, like, get some fresh air, and the second the sun hit me, I was like, in the heat. I just started throwing up. And I threw up my breakfast, and there were full chunks of apples. But the other wake up call was that I need to chew my food a lot better. I'm laying on my gym couch, shaking, heart rates pounding, sweating, cold, hot, like, back and forth. I laid there for a total of four and a half hours. And there were bits in between where I was like, okay, let me take a sip of water. And I would puke that up or try and text someone to figure out what the fuck's going on with me. Long story short, the formula was written as 200 mg of Hooper scene rather than 200 mg. A microgram is 1,000 milligrams, so I took 2,000 times the dose. Honestly, I'm lucky that I am big enough to handle that and it wasn't more serious. We will not be Making that product. But the point is, this is my weird brain, the way it works. I was lying there, I realized that that was probably the first time in a day, a decade or longer where I just done nothing. I feel like I'm constantly trying to consume, to progress myself, to learn something, to be smarter, to be a better parent. Stimulating my brain way too much and trying to consume essentially, rather than just part of me felt really calm. I felt a little bit more at peace than I have for a while. Felt a little bit like anxious recently. And I feel like, cause I just keep trying to do too much too often. I feel like it's so rare now for people to appreciate doing nothing. And I remember I had this old quote from this book I read in my phone. Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found? You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You can find and build and learn the most beautiful collections of thoughts and emotions and actions, but ultimately it's still not you. You are the one that built it. And I feel like that's like such a anger for me right now, is I'm trying to like consume all these things to be someone I wanna be, to feel the way I wanna feel and to progress rather than Being present in the moment and remembering that, like, who I am is always been here. There's still, like, the core of me. Being able to slow down sometimes in life and go back to that. That was a lesson I Learned from that. It's like, okay, you have some time now. It doesn't have to be learning or consuming. It can be just being with yourself and learning who you are, learning what you need to let go of, what you need to shed off of yourself, rather than adding in more. So that was my lesson that I Learned from my experience of overdosing on hooping. Take what you will from it. I'm taking that from it.",23600000

Be like that. When I was young, I was like, okay, that's how I have to be to win. But it didn't make me feel like I was getting better. If anything it stressed me out, it made me anxious cause I was comparing myself to others and like trying to be what they were.

So if you're trying to beat them or do what the judges do and the judges switch what they want, then you're just pissed cause you didn't do what you want.

In the middle of prep. I was four weeks out of the Olympia. Whoa. At this point, it was like, one of the biggest moments of feeling powerless, just completely powerless. And there's a pastor I believe in, this Richard Rohr, who talks about every man experiencing a journey of powerlessness, which leads to a sense of humility and gratitude for the rest of your life, cause you realize you're not fully in control. There's so much you can do, but there's always a level beyond what you're capable of. So I think my journey, starting with that, really LED to every moment of success.

So for example, if you're doing four sets of 10, which I was just doing on the flat press, I like to be in like an aim for 10, but be in a 20% variance. So if I hit eight, I'm still in at rep range. But the goal is 10. Obviously if I'm able to do four sets of 10 at the same weight, I need to up that weight. So in the goal of progressive overload, last week I was able to do four sets of 10. So this week I did the one tens first instead of my second set. And that progressed up to the one 20s where I only got eight reps. So if I was being smart, I would know in my third set I would not get eight reps, I'd get less than that. So either drop the weight a little bit and then next week don't go up so fast and go up to 1 fifteen instead of 1:20. So I'm saying that 20% variance. But I was kind of ego lifting today and I didn't really give a fuck. I want to do the 1:20 again. Some days you feel good, one let's have you weight and you just throw the books out the window. Guess what? If you're training hard, you still get jacked.",23600000

But at the end of the day for 90% of you just have to get in a, it's hard. My 2.5 pounds don't fit on the dumbbells, doesn't matter. I'm gonna push myself heavier with more weight, get a little bit less reps. But if I'm pushing myself progressively harder and harder stomach and gains. I'm just passionate about learning about more nuances of how to continue to drive progress same thing of picking the best program. The best program is the one that you're gonna adhere to the best. If I'm going through a phase where I'm like, I've been training for 10 years, I wanna try a very specific things that are proven to drive progress more and that keeps me interested in training harder, then it's working for me better than just focusing on just intensity. And eventually intensity is more likely to hit you with a plateau if you're doing the same over and over and you're trying to do it harder and harder. So number one way to make gains is the train hard. Don't be skinny, do what you can, just don't let it ruin the fun of the workout.

Don't even think about what you're doing other than tracking your food. Just having that conscious awareness of what you're putting in your body consistently allows you to progress so much better. Physique updates. I'm gonna look at my physique right now, but oh, I still look good, but like compared to what I was or where I wanna be, I'm not there. Having consistent weekly check ins where I'm doing that consistently tracking my food, consistently tracking thing. It's the biggest thing to reinforce discipline. Rather than just saying, I know how to eat healthy, I'll just do it like, no, you're not, fuck off. You know, even I can't do that shit. Logging your weights has been one of the biggest changes I made in the last couple of years for driving progress. Cause on the days where you come in and you feel like shit, like well last week I did 1 10 for 6, I better do it again at least this week if I feel worse. Pushes you to be better.

Let me show you how to change it in five easy steps. Step one, let's locate where to find your spare tire. For the most part, it'll be here in the trunk. So if you lift up the handle right here, you'll find your spare. Let's grab the tire and let's grab the Jack. Step 2. We gotta loosen up the lug nuts. Step 3, we're going to Jack up the car. So grab your Jack and locate the pinch weld under the car and try to line it up. Now that it's lined up, I'm going to connect the extension piece and really start to lift the car off the ground to be able to get that tire off. Step four. Now that the tires off the ground, it's time to take out the lug nuts and replace the tire. Let's get this flat tire out of here. Step 5. We are almost done replacing our flat tire, but this step is super important. So once the tires on and we put our lug nuts back on, we want to ensure that we're tightening them in a star formation to make sure to balance the load on the tire. And there you have it. It's that easy to replace a flat tire. Now lower the Jack, tighten the lug nuts once again once they're on the ground, and you're back on the road.",14200000

Acne has impacted my confidence at times, but I’ve learned that the best thing I can do is consistently take care of my skin and with patience. When I was in Dallas, I met my first esthetician who introduced me to @Face Reality , a brand that finally felt right for me.

And if you are currently going through something or you are facing mental health issues, I kind of want to just talk about how to become stronger in yourself and how to get help if you are currently struggling. So the first thing I wanna say is reach out to someone. Never just bottle up your emotions inside. Sometimes we are weak as humans and we need connection. We need to talk to people. If you don't have family or friends that you can trust or truly rely on without feeling judged or criticized, then please seek help through professionals, whether that be a therapist or maybe it's a online call center that you can just call and speak to. But I would really recommend just please reaching out to someone that you can trust. The next thing that I want to talk about is the importance of taking care of yourself through habits. So one thing that I really noticed when my mental health would decline is if I'm going through a low period in life, we will consume ourselves with things that distract us from feeling that pain. So it will be escaping through external things, whether that is social media, TV, maybe it's different kinds of addictions. So when you realize that you're doing Things to escape that emotion. You have to feel your emotions and feel your pain and go through it and become stronger through better habits, like waking up early, going to sleep on time, going to the gym, going for a walk. Maybe it's picking up a side hustle and trying to figure out your purpose in this life. And I think that's also a very important thing, is purpose. And you have to remember that we are all created differently. We are all so unique. And the creator of the world has put you here for a reason, for a purpose. And sometimes we have to find our purpose. And that means being alone with our thoughts and not constantly consuming ourselves with things. So whether that is locking your apps, deleting apps off of your phone, um, trying to occupy yourself in better habits, but taking care of ourselves is probably one of the most important things. After being able to reach out to someone for help. And I am sending every single person who struggles with mental health so much love, because it is such a. It's such a dark journey sometimes, and you have to just find the light and truly believe that you are here for a reason, and you have so much purpose in this life.",11600000

It's gonna help you with, like, endurance and also building your speed and increasing your time or decreasing your time. So I'm actually very excited to do this. Weirdly, I like intervals.

But I'm gonna be completely honest, it doesn't really taste like pumpkin spice. It's like eggnog. You want coffee? No. No coffee for you. Okay, bro, why are you so scared right now? I'm doing a one and a half mile run at, like, a super light pace. And this is just a warm up before we start the intervals. Why am I already breathing so hard? Okay, after the one and a half mile warm up, we now have a 90 second walk, and then we start the intervals, which is like three rounds for point five miles at like a nine minute pace. So, yeah. And we're done.",11600000

Although it is damaging to our soul.   I used to be addicted to music. I would wake up with it, sleep with it - when I was sad, I listened to music to make me even more sad. Vise versa when it came to “wanting to feel happy” .  Why do we let something like music have so much control over our moods? Why is it that a song comes on when we’re training and it makes us train even harder? Or if a song we don’t like starts playing, we won’t train as hard. Let’s not forget that some of us would SKIP the gym because we forgot our headphones (I was guilty of this).  I didn’t want anything having that much control over me or my mood.  I can focus on mind to muscle connection better when I have no music. I can focus on using my mind to get me through the toughest sets of my workout / runs without depending on anything. Thus building more mental strength within me to apply to the real world.  The last thing I want to say is this is purely from a psychological view. if I were to speak about it from a faith pov - secular music is damaging and degrading to society & women. Hence why it is spiritually toxic when it comes to practicing our faith. Because we rely on music to lift us up rather than relying on the words of god. 🤍 ",2500000,178700,3006,4981,leanadeeb,6762609913108005894,https://www.tiktok.com/@leanadeeb,MS4wLjABAAAAIvcWY-cLB_AE4KhhZ_WsaheCgvf3IGWIA8Qy665DacLMfbzc4vZBo2zxyxnZkDo7,Leana Deeb,2025-09-16,1758060705,10,,original sound,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@leanadeeb/video/7550813148442381598,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/o0VIAEfBjfjIRA4fJkqkT7KyVuxDICFBqNSIX8~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=KAY899Pr5KBaAWN5qUFw7ESJb%2FI%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,,11600000

And by that, I mean when I started posting content, I was posting fitness, food. And then I transitioned into more faith, but still posting fitness and food. But now I'm fully covered up, right? And so as I made that risk in my life, it meant being authentically myself, not caring the consequence of what happens, how many people I would lose, how many people I would upset. And I am now in another chapter of my life where I am deeply, so passionate about topics that are slightly controversial. It could be including faith, politics, world issues. And I think that I am so afraid of giving my input because I am afraid of fearing what people will think. Maybe it's brands, my community. And I am now just still living this misalignment and this deep feeling of, I need to come on here and speak my truth. I wanna come on here and give my insight or my opinions on topics that might be beneficial in this world today. And so I think that I am making this video to be clear that I will still be posting fitness, food, and content that I built my platform off of. But I will now be sharing my opinions on world issues, on politics, on things that you may not care about or things that you might agree or Maybe you disagree with, but I want to just be myself fully. And whoever loves me for me is going to stay, and whoever doesn't agree with me, then is going to leave. And I think that whenever you are transitioning and your life and you're evolving as a person, you can't be afraid to lose people, you can't be afraid to take risk. And that's what it means to authentically be yourself 100% is not fearing the consequence, not fearing the risk of fully showing up as yourself. And so I am making this video to just be clear that I will be speaking about topics that might be slightly controversial, but I will still be posting fitness and food and all these other things. And I deeply appreciate every single person who has stuck by my side through this journey, because I would not be able to continue to do what I do without the support of you. And so thank you so much. And yeah, I hope that you guys enjoy the content that I share. And I love you all so much.",11600000

So the first thing is to not overlook the importance of nutrition and recovery. So when we are training in the gym and we are pushing past our limits, training till failure, going for that last rep, we are literally breaking our muscles and tearing them apart. So we have to recover them properly by eating enough protein, getting it, enough sleep, drinking enough water. Otherwise, how do you expect your muscles to recover and help you build the dream physique that you were working towards? Which leads me into my second point, following a consistent training program. So when you follow a consistent program, you are gonna be able to master your form and then increase in weight over time. And doing movements that are your basic fundamentals, not switching it up every single time and doing random different exercises. It. It's about doing the boring things consistently in order to see results. Which leads me into my third point, discipline over motivation. Because training requires consistency, and consistency requires discipline. So when you don't feel like going to the gym, you have to remember that you are doing this to be consistent. Stop telling yourself, tomorrow, if you said you're gonna train three times a week, train three times a week. Don't go back on your word and negotiate with yourself. And now getting into number four. Progress isn't linear, and it never will be. It's gonna Be an up and down journey, and you have to accept that and embrace every single chapter of your life. Because our bodies are gonna go through so many phases. And I hear way too many people saying that I hate myself, so that's why I'm going to the gym. No, you should start loving yourself and that's why you are going to the gym or moving your body. Because when you start to associate hatred with movement, then you're not gonna be able to love this journey. Fitness has truly changed my life, not only physically, but also mentally. It has help me gain more confidence in myself, more strength. And so if you are serious about changing your life and wanting to start this journey, on Monday, August 18th, I will be doing a 30 day challenge called The Blueprint, where we practice habits that will help us stay accountable. And so I will leave more details in the caption below. I'm wishing you the best of luck with your fitness journey.",11600000

myself this different woman it means removing people from your life it means like uncovering traumas that you might have experienced and it's just about being very self aware knowing what's aligned with you knowing what's not aligned with you and like yeah so I've just been in this like mental mental like funk kind of thing like and honestly my way of doing things is escaping my problems like I wanna go on a trip I want to move cities hence I moved to New York and I still am struggling with the same problem when I was in Dallas okay and it's all because I am a person who wants to escape reality and not just like focus on fixing the issue within me and like really being in tune with myself like I will fill the void with work I will fill the void with everything else but uncovering the trauma and the things that I'm actually going through and so what we need to do if you are struggling with mental health I want you to first start off by just making a simple routine okay do not over plan do not say you're gonna commit to so many different things and then you're not even gonna end up sticking to your word and then you're gonna feel like crap after that because you feel like you cannot even keep the promises that you made to yourself so I want you to stick to a routine and be realistic like what is sustainable start small and then build and really commit to it like you know whenever we say we're gonna do something but then like subconsciously we don't even believe it you have to fully fully believe it and envision yourself of okay I am this person I am a disciplined individual I will show up every single day you have to embody that and truly truly have that intention it's all about the intention because for example I have prayer in the morning okay and if I tell myself that oh if I went to sleep late and I have to wake up at four if I say oh um yeah I'm gonna wake up I'm gonna set my alarm but I don't truly truly believe it maybe the alarm will go off but I'll I'll hit snooze and that's what I used to do I don't do that now but like it was a point in my life where I was doing that but that's the difference because whenever I started having the intention even when I went to sleep late oh okay I'm gonna go to sleep and I'm gonna make sure that I get up I would still get up because the intention is different does that make sense so you have to have the intention with every single thing that you do and another thing is like right now it's Sunday right like I'm prepping my meals I'm gonna make sure that I go to sleep early that's probably one of the biggest thing like is just going to sleep early and y'all our phones are a very big distraction in our lives and it's really not even just like not like don't bring it into your room like don't wake up and the first thing you do is check your phone like don't even set yourself up for failure like download apps on your phone like Opal this is not sponsored I would download this app called Opal where you would basically like lock your app so for example in the morning you can set it for a certain amount of time but like lock your apps don't bring your phone into your room like have your room be a sacred place where no phones are allowed because a lot of it is social media that's also making us I don't know like our minds it's just doing so much to our minds um but these platforms are meant to be addictive so they can be a good thing but they can also have a negative effect on us if we overuse them and not only that you need to get in movement okay so whether that be walking running any kind of movement right prep your fits in advance so the night before you do not want to wake up and then stress about what you're gonna wear and then end up not going because you don't know what to wear or you are literally so tired of trying to figure out a fit like these things happen and then the next thing I would say is like read more like consume yourself with knowledge that is actually going to educate you not consume your mind with so much social media consume knowledge from books like learn new topics things that you will enjoy and y'all it's really just about like spending our time on things that are gonna make us feel good it's hard to be disciplined but you have to believe that you can do it and another thing is like if you do not change now right your bad habits or if you're stuck in this constant cycle if you don't change right now nobody's gonna come to save you like that's a hard thing that I had to realise like nobody is coming to save you and you have to use that as like this is gonna empower me to show up for myself don't don't fear it don't fear that like you know things are gonna go wrong like take it as this like challenge that okay I am this person who can do hard things and so this is a really long video but like I just kinda just wanna open up and tell you where I've been mentally and if you have been mentally struggling like it's okay it's okay and I don't necessarily like the videos where it's like you know you don't have time like you do have time but like you can't have that mindset forever does that make sense you cannot have that mindset of like oh I have time it's gonna be okay like tomorrow whatever like yes god is going to have every single opportunity waiting for you when you're ready to show up but like don't prolong it like you know what you need to do you know what you need to stop doing you know the distractions that you keep going into you know the people that are in your life that you don't need in your life anymore like all these different things and yeah so um that was kind of a big rant but I hope you guys are getting ready for the week um I wasn't really posting much on here on like TikTok because to be fair like Yoh I was just going through it mentally I couldn't show up on here like I didn't even know how to be myself and so um that's why I'm in therapy but anyways I love you guys so much I hope you guys are getting ready for the week and um yeah take care of yourself mentally because I know a lot of people out there are struggling with mental health and it is a very very serious thing so please take care of yourself and show up for you because the only way that you're gonna get through mental challenges is through okay,11600000

Line a 5- by 9-inch loaf pan, preferably one with a light interior, with enough waxed paper to drape over the long sides. This will make the baked bread a cinch to remove and the pan easy to clean. Set the pan aside. Step 2 sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl. In a large bowl, cream the butter using an electric mixer. Gradually add the sugar, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Next, add the vanilla extract and blend briefly. Set both bowls aside. Step 3: Peel the bananas and place them in a separate bowl. Mash them with a fork or a potato masher and measure out 1 cup. Add the sour cream and stir to blend. Set the bowl aside. Step 4: Using a wooden spoon (see box at right), blend a third of the dry mixture into the butter-sugar mixture. Add the rest of the ingredients in this order, stirring well after each addition: half of the banana mixture, half of the remaining dry mixture, the rest of the banana mix-ture, the rest of the dry mixture. Next, add mix-ins if desired  Step 5: Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spoon. Bake on the center oven rack until a tester inserted deep into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 70 to 75 minutes. Step 6 Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and cool it in the pan for about 20 minutes. Using the waxed paper, lift the bread from the pan and place it on the rack. Pull down the sides of the paper and allow the bread to cool thoroughly before slicing.

The speech is going to be posted on the Oxford Union, their page, but it's like a surreal moment for me. It feels, like, really unreal. Like, I've always grown up just watching those Oxford debates and, like, how intense they are and stuff, and I actually love debating, but this is the very first time I'm doing something like this. I've done speeches, or one speech, which was at a school, and it was honestly the worst speech I've ever done in my life. I've done Q and as where, like, people ask me questions in big crowds, but nothing like a full on speech. Like, let me show you. I've literally written out a speech. So here it is.

And they are saying things that women are going to the gym with the intention to be sexualized and the intention to always have men's attention on them and wanting men to look at them in a lustful way. And not only are they talking about gym attire, but they are also talking about things that women wear to the beach. And I am someone who wears a hijab, but I was also a woman who once wore shorts and sports bras to the gym. So I understand both perspectives. Whenever I used to wear shorts and sports bras, I wanted to feel confident within myself. I like going to the gym and feeling comfortable in the clothes that I'm wearing, and I love looking at myself in the mirror and being able to see my pump. If I ever had a man staring at me, I would always stare him down back as if like, why are you staring at me? I am here to train. Doesn't matter what I'm wearing. I don't give you the right to stare at me. And you know what's so crazy? Men feel very entitled. If we dress a certain way, meaning if we are maybe not as covered, that means it has, like, they have the right to be able to stare us down. Like, no, you need to learn self control, learn how to literally lower your gaze. Like, women are not asking for your attention, and this is not a job at all, men. But they will come on here and criticize women for wearing shorts and sports bras, but then they will come on here and criticize women who are fully covered up. So, you know what? Please let women wear what they want to wear. And if you ever want to give education onto why women should be modest, talk about it in a way where it's Protection from men living in a hypersexualized world, which is one of the reasons why I cover, because I was tired of getting catcalled and constantly looked up and down because men treat us as if we are objects. And so, again, not a bash at men. And for the women that are applauding the men for speaking about us in a negative way or speaking about the women wearing shorts and sports bras to the gym, you need to really, like, look within. Like, what's empowering as women? Uplifting each other, not putting each other down by saying one person is better than the other. And yeah, um, why am I getting emotional about this topic? Like, literally, again, it's not a job at men, but, like, seriously, y'all need a reality check to look within yourselves and learn how to have more self control by lowering your gaze.",11600000

Full body workout. And we're doing a circuit, so it's basically all back to back. And the first movement we are doing is a B stance RDL with a row. And so for your stance, you wanna have one foot in front of the other, the back foot being toe down, heel up. A B stance RDL is one of my favourite movements for growing the glutes and adding in a single arm row is great for your back. The second movement is a DB sumo squat. So you're basically gonna have a bit of a wide stance and you're gonna lean forward, pushing your hips back as you come down for a squat. The third movement is a DB half get up. This is going to target our core, and I'm basically holding my stomach to make sure that I'm really engaging my core. Make sure you repeat the same amount of reps on each side. The fourth movement we are doing is a side lunge with a knee drive. This is one of my favourite movements for stability and balance, but also growing our lower body. And the final movement we are doing is a bicep curl into a press. This is going to target our biceps and our shoulders. I hope you enjoy this workout and let me know if you try it.",11600000

I mix mine with cardamom and honey and it's also an antioxidant and has L theanine so it promotes focus and productivity. I drink this while I read and write and work and then I get into my breakfast which is high in protein. Steak, bacon, eggs. I also mix my water with creatine and greens for muscle recovery. And then this meal was honestly so good. So simple. I literally finished every single inch of it. I prioritise lots of water and then I also have another matcha cause it's just so good. Before I got into my workout I had a quick snack which was dates and almond butter which is high in fibre. I also had an energy drink. Well half of it because it spilled over and then got into an at home session. And then after that I had my lunch. I literally just had potatoes, chicken and salad.

I say this because every single time I don't spend a weekend preparing properly, my week is not the same. So let's start with, if you are not consistent in the gym or running, whatever it is that you enjoy doing, start by just stretching. And after that, make a plan. Know exactly what you're gonna be doing throughout the week. Don't wait till the last minute. And then what are you eating? Because if you are not fueling your body properly, you are gonna feel low energy, and then you're gonna also choose unhealthy options. So I highly recommend you prepare in advance, whether that's meal prepping, choosing healthy options, but know exactly what you're eating and what time of the day that you're eating. Another crucial step is being able to offset your mind. So going out alone, and I say this because it's so important for us as creatives, and every single one of us has creativity, but you're able to spend time, see what you love to do, like, who are you as a person? And all of these things are gonna help you prepare for the week and have a strong mind.",11600000

I then have my matcha and I mix that with oat milk and honey. For breakfast, I had this bowl, which sweet potato glazed with arugula sausage, quinoa, pickled onions, avocado, hard boiled eggs. So fire and literally so easy to make. Then before the gym, I had a Bloom Energy drink and literally gave me so much energy because I was needing it for sure. Then after that, I had a chicken Milanese and a cabbage salad. My mom put me onto this recipe and it's so good. It's like a pomegranate vinaigrette. And then in the middle of the day, I had some watermelon juice because it's so hydrating, and some dates with almond butter.

Gymshark is having their spring sale, so now is the perfect time to give you my favourite recommendations because it is literally on sale. I started off with just base layers of more slimming items, like a perfect legging, a perfect base layer top that covers my stomach. And that was my first step into modesty. We're gonna start in levels. This is beginner. Okay, you're covering your legs, but it's still on the tighter side. These are the vital seamless leggings. I was always wearing these leggings, and these were honestly amazing. I would then match that to cover my stomach in full, so this still looks, like, sleek, effortless, and very, like, elegant. If that top is too tight, then there is also another vital seamless zip, which is more on the looser end. If you feel like you're already past that stage and you want to, like, cover your bottom and you want it more of a looser fit, there is also the vital seamless long line top, and all of these will match the leggings. This is another long line top that you can wear, and it's also so stretchy and breathable. I love to layer this top underneath all of my t shirts. If you feel like you don't wanna wear leggings, you can also do a training jogger, which, again, this is a cotton blend, so it's super lightweight. It's Breathable, it's not gonna be too hot. And it still looks like so sleek and elegant. It doesn't even look like you're trying to be modest. It looks like just a nice training jogger. And if you're someone who's looking for 100% cotton, this is a tunic top, so you can basically tighten the waist, so it kind of gives like this dress effect. And you can also wear it with the matching flares. So this is how it looks with like, the matching flares, which obviously this is like another step into modesty. So as you can see, this was kind of like how my journey was. I went from like, tighter to like, looser. And then now I'm wearing things like abayas. This is an abaya, and this is what I personally wear to the gym. And sometimes I'll mix and match with like, joggers and stuff. But as I become more modest, I have been wearing more of like the dresses or the skirts. And I also styled this by adding a T-shirt over it. You could use any kind of training T-shirt, but this is how it looks on. So this is how I styled the abaya. I added a T-shirt over it, and then underneath is the abaya and then a built in hijab, which is also from Gymshark. So everything that I showed you is up to 50% off right now with the Gymshark sale. And if you use my code LEANA10 you Can save 10% on top of that. I hope you guys love these pieces, and I'm wishing you the best of luck with your modesty journey.",11600000

And by that, I meant I loved being the baddest in the room, okay? I loved feeling, like, walking in and everyone looks at me like, as arrogant as that sounds, that's the person I was. And honestly, what LED me to putting on the hijab was not only connecting to my faith, but it was really understanding the meaning of modesty. I craved external validation so much to the point where it literally was my confidence. That's where I got my confidence was by walking into a room and someone looking at me or someone telling me that I was beautiful based off of my external. So there's many reasons for modesty. My reason was, yes, protecting my beauty, yes, getting closer to god, but also to not crave external validation anymore and feel confident from within me. And so something I realized now is even though I put on the hijab, you're still gonna crave it. But now you just have to still find that confidence from within you. Always.",11600000

The next hijab I'm gonna be showing you is just a scarf, but the material is super lightweight and perfect for the gym. I like to do a tighter look. I take both sides and put a magnet in the middle, and I cross them. Basically, just now I'm taking another magnet, I'm gonna grab both ends and put them together. You have this, like, elegant look, and it also comes in this beautiful yellow. So this is the very last hijab I wanna show you, which is honestly one of my favorites. It has a drawstring. You can tuck it into your shirt as well. I hope you enjoy this video and let me know which one is your favorite.",11600000

And he was of the Christian faith. Now, he was saying this because he wanted to be able to basically gain an audience off of respecting him and being able to trust his opinion in fitness because of how he built his physique. And so this is a valid perspective, because for someone who has built their platform off of showing their body and then putting on the hijab, it has been a constant question that I get of does she still have the same physique? Or we don't feel as inspired anymore because you're not showing your body. And I think the issue with this is, as I've evolved, my perspective in life, fitness is much more than just going to the gym for your body. And if you maintain that same mindset that I am just going to train or I'm just going to for a run because I wanna lose weight, you are not gonna be able to maintain consistency because that's such a short term goal. You should have the mindset that I am doing this for my overall health, and there are so many people in this world that have that mindset. So for you not posting your content because you are scared of faith, right? You're scared of not being able To practice your faith in full. If you do post content, don't start conforming to societal beliefs and expectations. Start staying true to you and find that community and that audience that truly resonate with your message. And I promise you will gain way more success, even long term, because you are staying true to your beliefs and that is always going to win in the long run.",11600000

And just writing the things that you're grateful for in life. And also holding yourself accountable for all your actions. The second thing is taking care of yourself by presenting yourself in a certain way and not only for others, but for yourself and the sake of god. The third thing is your nutrition. The foods that you put into your body are going to impact your energy and the way that you feel. Not only that, showing appreciation and love and care to those around you. Once you're taking care of yourself, you then need to focus on building your relationship with god through his teachings. Whether that's learning and reading and writing, or maybe it's prayer and trying to be more present in the moment. And the last thing I wanna mention is faith is a journey and you have to take it one step at a time. Sometimes it will feel weaker and sometimes it will feel stronger.

I've been thinking, remember when Panera Bread got sued cause it was so delicious and caffeinated that people were over consuming? That's how I feel about that. But it is very delicious. Hip thrust pushing till it is very painful. That was not painful enough. That's okay. Um, next I like to do stiff leg deadlifts. You can also do RDL. But my hamstrings need more work than my glutes tbh for me, so that's why I do stiff legs. Classic Bulgarians. I'm doing a little bit of a wider stance. Pendulum swinging for a little bit more of the glute and hamstring. But of course, the quads are also gonna be active. My least favorite exercise. Girls, I always do lying hamstrings because my gym only has the lying hamstring machine. So that's also, you know, why I'm doing other hamstring movements. Finally. Back or glute extension? This one. Don't sleep on it. Don't sleep on it. It is actually quite taxing. A little pause at the top. You can also do it unweighted, or you can do it with a band for a different type of resistance.

That's because I do not fear textures. Actually, textures fear me. Lunch. Buttering the pan. I don't measure the butter cause I just cannot be bothered. Ground chicken. I did not film all of the lunch, but it was ground chicken. Oats, because it's just easier to cook oats for me than like rice or something. And beans. Green beans specifically, not other beans. Pre workout I have nitric, which is non stim. No caffeine because I did have a lot of coffee. Dinner. I had this kombucha. I measured it, but then I forgot to track it, so I don't know. It's not tracked. More butter. I like butter because I don't like working with oil. And I really don't like cooking with that spray cause I can taste it and it just does not taste good to me. So I do the butter and I. I don't really care what it adds up to. This was like a major fart meal. It was steak, which was basically raw. I did a terrible job. Sardines and oil and Brussels sprouts.

I can't say that is a common occurrence, so I'm taking advantage of enjoying doing these. I enjoyed that. Then I did pendulum squat. This was the same weight that I did last week and I could not get that up. So obviously I gave up and went home after this. Just kidding. I lightened the weight and up the rep range, but I was still pretty upset that I couldn't get that weight. But you know, that was just a bummer. Then I did something that I used to really enjoy but I haven't been enjoying lately. Goblet squats. I used my Versa Grips wrist wraps as like wrist support cause the first one was 100 pounds and that was heavy. That hurt my little baby wrists. And then I lower it. I basically do a giant drop set. Heavy, half the weight, no weight, then leg extension. I try to control the weight as best as I can up until it's suffering pain. I'm hating this, but I'm loving it.

Ah, I'm not gonna tell you what to do or what not to do, but, um, I don't know. I wouldn't do it. Seems kind of sketchy. TikTok, why are you permitting this? Am I crazy for thinking that that's weird? I think that that's not good. I think it's not good.",8100000

Someone expressing their struggles with binge eating. And obviously, I'm not speaking for everybody, okay? Different situations are very different. But something to think about if you think, oh, I have binge eating disorder. I'm not saying you don't, you know, I'm just saying think about it. Maybe if your diet, like, your regular diet is overly restrictive, that's why you're benching. If you're super lean all the time for a long period of time, probably your diet is restrictive. That's why you're binging. And I honestly think there's a fair amount of people that recognize, like, yeah, that's. That's what's happening, but they're not totally ready to be honest with themselves which life, you know, not to be one of those people. It's a journey, but, like, really, it is. You come to term terms with things on your own time. Maybe more so for, like, the newer gym goers or people trying to, like, diet, whatever, whatever. They might not. They might not realize that that's what they're setting themselves up for. So if you're spirit experiencing red regular binging, my first piece of advice is if you are fortunate enough to afford therapy. Therapy freaking rocks. But it might be you are being overly restrictive. Just food for thought. This doesn't apply to everyone, but just food For thought",8100000

That's something I love to say because I certainly don't know everything I don't claim to. And don't worry, I'm not about to turn my whole page into fitness and politics. But I think this is a really interesting point to make that the modern fitness culture in at least the United States is actually a direct result of historical political tensions. 30s and 40s communist countries, Eastern Europe. Thinking about that, fitness was actually a really big propaganda tool that they used to encourage a sense of strong nationalism. Like also not only metaphorically strong, but literally physically strong. And I think that it's really interesting because they didn't only encourage it in men, which ended up kind of being something we did in the United States, but they also encouraged it in women. So it was everybody who was supposed to be strong. Flash forward a little bit. We can look at examples like Kennedy's The Soft American, which also called for a advocacy of nationalism through fitness and creating, um, like strong men in particular. So it was really pushed upon men to be physically strong. I think that's why in modern America, we see fitness as still being, and I don't mean like wellness, I mean like fitness as still being a really male dominated space. And it is even to the point of toxic masculinity, which I feel like that's almost a trigger word for some People. But talk. Toxic masculinity is also really bad for men. Okay, uh, so I don't know, this is just something to think about. I, I feel like it's really interesting. And just because you don't work out for political reasons doesn't mean fitness is not political. So that's just a think piece. Let me know. Let me know what you think.",8100000

Right now is your time to shine. This is the moment you've been waiting for. Where I've been seeing at least the don't tread on me Americans is in protest of what's going on in LA right now with the ice rage, the mass deportations, the National Guard being in there. We could argue morals and ethics all day, I don't think it makes a huge difference to do so, because people will always have different ethical views and different morals. So if you want to say it's legal, it's a federal crime to be in this country undocumented, okay. But what's above any federal laws is the Constitution. And within the Constitution, all people, regardless of citizenship status, they still have certain rights. And right now, these people in LA, their rights are being encroached upon. They're being taken away. It's not just liberty and justice for you and your family, it's liberty and justice for all. So if we ever want to make America great at all, it's important to fight for the rights of everybody, not just yourself. Because once you let them take the rights away from some groups, they'll come for you too, because they see that you are weak. And if you still feel that the raids and the mass deportations are justified for any reason, I would simply urge you to reflect on how you would react if your family Was being hunted in the streets and detained with no knowledge of their whereabouts, their conditions, how long they'll be there.

Okay, I'm finally doing it. I'm finally making what everyone has been asking for. Very high demand savory jello. In case you were wondering, um, this is a Chef Pat original recipe. I did not think of the idea by myself though. Thank you! I don't remember the commenter that commented on the last video, but someone commented to do this. Vaguely, not exactly. They said try using chicken broth instead of water. That's what was commented. So I kind of am getting experimental now. Chicken broth? Yeah. Sit, sit. Good. Sit. Oh my god, no. Good sit, baby. No. I think important. I'm gonna note I did get a lot of comments last time saying not to put it in the glass because your glass will explode. I am using oven safe glass so it's better for high temperatures. But now I am afraid so I'm not gonna put it directly in there. Most important ingredient the two jello packets. Room temperature chicken broth. Flavorings of choice. Today I have salt free chicken seasoning. Salt, dill weed. Dill weed, mashed. Alright, now I'm gonna cover it and put it in the fridge overnight. So fingers crossed guys. I really don't hate it. It's like cold solid soup. It really is. Something about it reminds me of a holiday. Don't ask me what I. I think it's because um, the bra, like, it kind of tastes like a stuffing in a way. Or when chicken and Turkey fat. Solidifies it looks like the solidified fat. I'm liking it. Would I make it again over the sweet one? Probably not. Will I finish it? I will. Thank you for watching.",8100000

To be totally fair, I did expect a lot of people to think eating jello in cereal was weird. I just like all the funky textures. I like the weird textures. I didn't expect this. And I didn't expect so many people to be like, what is this? Like, are you okay? It's literally jello. I think what it is, is because I post predominantly fitness content, a lot of people thought I was trying to do, like, high protein, healthy this, that, the other, that. It's just jello, guys. It's really. It's not that deep. It's just jello. Backstory on how I acquired all this unflavored gelatin. I actually saw a different recipe on this app where a woman had unflavored gelatin and frozen fruit. She made it look really good, so I tried it. I didn't like it cause it was unflavored. The unflavored has no taste, so I didn't eat it again. Flash forward to current time. A year later, I have all this unflavored jello. I don't like to waste food, so I figured out a way to make it sweet. To me, it tastes like brown sugar Boba with the texture of Jello. Okay, but yeah, I mean, there's no need to be concerned. I just. I literally just like jello. Okay, so try it out. If it's not sweet enough for you, add more honey. All right. Add more Flavoring. I would have used vanilla, but I didn't have any vanilla at the time. So that's why I used maple. Thanks, guys.",8100000

I'm actually not confident if you should wait for the boiling water or put it on the bottom first. We'll just do half and half, cause it's kind of, like a lot. I usually change it every single time anyway. Okay, maybe. I don't know. You're supposed to do it on the top. I do make this frequently, but even every time I make it, I'm not totally sure what I'm doing. Mix. It's kind of stinky. It kind of stinks. I don't know what that's all about, but it doesn't smell nice. It tastes. It tastes fine, though. Try to do it evenly. Now, you can either eat this on its own or on something. I usually like to put it on top of my cereal. Maple flavoring. You can use whatever flavor you want. That's the joy of the flavorless jello, is you get to flavor it yourself. Honey smells so good with the maple. And another cup of water. Perfect. Okay. And then cover it and let it sit, preferably all day or overnight. And there you have it. Oh, this is an example of how I like to eat it in cereal. So if you don't Like a bunch of conflicting, weird textures. Don't eat it like that. But try it out. Let me know what you think.",8100000

I'm sorry. But they look so good. I won't tag it unless they are so good. Even just the people crinkling the bag. That's how I first knew I had an issue with food was whenever I was in class and someone would pull something out of a plastic bag, I'd be like, food? You know, it would like trigger a response in me where I was like, fiending. Anyway, today I'm gonna try the Swedish candy from TikTok. I also love when they bite into it. It looks so difficult to chew. It looks really hard. Oh my gosh. But let's get a different candy. I'm gonna get this one cause it kind of looks like a Coke bottle. I mean, like it's. It looks like a face. But the colors. It's Coca Cola flavor. The fact that it comes in a mixed bag. I love that the variety. I love a mystery variety pack. Hmm, this one looks like it's gonna be grapefruit. What is that? Oh, it's watermelon. Hmm. Um, a ghost or a. A squid octopus. Okay, there's a couple more varieties in here, but I'm just gonna try this jelly bean looking one. I have a feeling this is going to be disgusting. And I'm really hoping it's not disgusting cause I kind of don't want to eat more. Oh, smells weird. Hmm. It's lemon. Not my favorite. Very subtle. Lemon taste, but it's not bad. Okay, one more. Cause I feel like this one of the top is like, its own main distinct thing, and it looks kind of freaky, like it's supposed to be meat or something. Hmm. Okay. Is it just like regular candy? Yes. Am I saying to go buy it? No. But thank you for watching this video. I really appreciate it. If you want it and I can figure out how to tag it, I'll put it in there. But, uh, if you're watching this, go get yourself a little treat, because you deserve a little treat. Thank you.",8100000

Let's go! First I start with pre workout Gorilla Mind. This is the non stimulant formula, but they also have a stimulated version, code beef for a discount. I recently lightened the weight for hip thrust. I. I mean, these buns can really thrust, let me tell you that. But I lightened it up because I was like you know what? I feel like my form could be a little more locked in. So I recently lightened it up. High stance leg press for the slightly more glute hamstring focused. I saw someone saying it's not more, you know, biased. Literally argue with your mother. What the freak. Rdls? I am actually a stiff leg deadlift enthusiast. I like stiff leg deadlifts. I don't know, something about it just feels so right for me. But I. I decided to also try doing RDL. So that's what that is. I feel like the form was pretty good. Deficit reverse lunges. It's kind of almost almost similar to a Bulgarian, but not quiet. I kind of prefer this though, because Bulgarians hurt my ankle. Then I did 40 minutes on the stair step. Level 8, level 5, that's whatever. And then I stood in the corner and posed for a second. Yada yada. The end. Thanks!",8100000

I really like to think about my glute dude doing the thrust squeezing at the top. Next I did single leg leg press. High stance is, you know, more hamstring glute. But of course in the quad will be in there. Watch the video the other day of a girl saying if you really want to make your glutes pop, don't work your quads at all. Ladies, gentlemen, germs and others, please still work your quads. Please anyway. Then I did belt squat. I don't really know how I feel about them, but today was pretty good. I kind of liked it. Next I did kickbacks though I never like these. I don't know why, I just don't freak with these.

The teams like, hey, let's launch a pumpkin spice protein for fall. And I'm like, oh, that's a fantastic idea, because Americans would love that. So I do have my concerns because we have a finished product, espresso shot. And that's how you make a fucking iced Americano latte. Pumpkin spice roll. Fucking rise the fuck up. That you could get a white girl hyped over. You can get some Uggs running towards that, tell you that much. And I do get why this is a thing. It's festive, it's seasonal, it's exclusive.

A lot of the comments were saying that this is ridiculous, but this is why I made that video. I grew up with a single mother who worked two jobs for us to barely survive. I vividly remember being 11 years old, comforting my crying mother, reassuring her that everything will be okay. You see most of my perception of life at a young age. Suffering and destruction. I understand that a lot of you are living a similar reality right now, and for that, I'm sorry. But far too many people take on the victim role in mindset, and they allow their past circumstances to determine their future negatively. Now, I understand how difficult this is, but channel your pain into fuel so that you can change your situation from something destructive into something beautiful. You are not at a disadvantage because I am living proof that your life can change. Become the father, friend, brother, or husband that your future family needs.",7500000

So I made it through T. S A. But I got patted down literally every fucking time. And sorry to disappoint, but I did not record that. Also my fucking Baggs didn't make it through. So we made it through. So we went to 7 11 because, well, the prices aren't as crazy as everywhere else in the airport. I met a fan. Oh I wasn't even recording. I'm sorry bro. Rookie, rookie era. And we got some food. I hope you enjoy this pointless time lapse of me eating grapes and berries. It's time to board the plane. And bros, I am a D1 American Airlines hater. Like they could have the best service ever, but like. I don't know. I've just had the worst experiences with them. Oh and ran into Ronnie Coleman because he was on the same flight. Got on the plane. And yes, I do fit even though I identify as plus size. Also shout out to X X Team official. He asked for a shout out? He's got 24 subscribers. Um, I do hope it's not some mommy ASMR kind of shit. Also, I ate my banana from 7 11 and I'm not showing you that you sick. I fell Right asleep. Jordan was super disappointed in me, but I can't help it. We made it. We're on our way to the pickup zone because my friend is coming to pick me up. Somebody asked for a tattoo tour, so real quick. Wrist, wrist, bicep, hand. Kieran's here. Haven't seen this bro in two months. Hey, just appreciate this bromance international. Good. Karen likes to talk a lot. And look at this huge dessert on my nose. Karen bought me chipotle cause he's a little lamb. And I'm about to fuck the shit up now. Miami looks pretty cool. In fact, it looks exactly like the movies. And when I came to America for the first time, I saw a yellow school bus and I didn't think that shit was real. Anyway, made it to the Airbnb and it's time to chill because I got a fucking crazy next few days. Love you guys. Bye. Bye.",7500000

Well, you'd be mistaken, because this is my typical Monday morning at 4:51 and I wake up. Thank I did, cause don't know what else I would do. These are my little puppies. They sleep with me, we cuddle. They're the cutest. Just look at that little head tilt. So they go outside for a wee, and, uh, I had to conceal the dogs because, well, no free feed pics. Always drink some water because hydration is important, and I haven't drank anything for like, eight hours. Yes, I put on fragrance to go and run, but I'm also a fragrance creator, and it's very important that I test fragrances before I review them. So this is Daisy. And the dogs go absolutely ballistic when it's time to go for a walk. She's cute as though. I conceal the bed head and let's fucking hit the road. First thing I do is my cardio. Either I do the peloton. But today I had to take the doggies for a walk because if I don't, they get a little bit destructive. And last time they ate a hole in my couch. Also, I saw these cute little sunflowers. Look how pretty they are. Then we got home. Now time for breakfast. I've cut out carbs in the morning, so I go with my four whole eggs and two egg whites. Now I can't just feed myself. I have to Feed the doggies, too. If I feed them too soon, they throw up. Oh, Daisy is very excited for her food. She's doing cartwheels. This is my first sip of caffeine for the day. Over at the Walmart exclusive Strawberry Sour Punch. So I gotta pick out something to wear. This is from the drop, you guys thought. Nope, not dropping the link. Get ready. Dry the hair, brush the teeth, skincare routine. You know, the usual. I don't know why this looks so awkward, but this is the fit of the day. And, uh, yeah, please go and comment, everyone, that I look good. Now, the second fragrance of the day, I had to go with gaso leather. And, yes, it smells like gasoline and leather. So I had to stank out the office for the day, and I'm gonna be driving the Hummer. I've been doing this for five years, and this is my first day in the life. And I hope it's a good video and it's not another. Oh, my god. Guys, come with me. This is typical Texas for you guys. If, uh, you guys haven't been to Texas. Well, here we arrived here at the office. This is rise, and, uh, this is our reception. I'm just showing you guys around. I got the arcade game, the pinball machine, um, and. Yep, this is the most hardest decision of my day. Picking out which energy drink I'm gonna have next. I went with my Usual cherry lemonade. Yeah. I'm making my way to the office. Oh, this. Sitting in the big boy chair and look at my awesome Godzilla collection. This is what I see for about 80% of my day. Um, yeah, but, yeah, it's a Monday morning, so lots to catch up. After the weekend, I usually go through all of my admin and then start with my meetings. You know, all of those fun things that the unemployed don't like. Then Nick and Brad came past to say hi. Obviously they missed me. And Brett bought me some samples of my new banana pudding protein. Yeah, now, my face definitely doesn't show it, but this shit was absolutely phenomenal. I love it. Props to Brett for helping me work on this flavour. Fucking phenomenal. Uh, this is Tyler and he brought me a package. Outlands. This is from Amwaj. They sent me a new fragrance. So another thing that I do is oversee the media marketing team. Uh, we're busy shooting for our new release. This is caramel apple. And, um, look at how dope this came out. So myself and Brad just tried a new secret pre workout formula, and we have two solid winners. Yeah, so, uh, this didn't go the best because only two out of six were actually approved. Then I had another meeting. It was really awkward to film, so I don't have too much footage about that second meal of the day. I have some Broccoli beef and rice. Honestly, I love it. It's super tasty. So I don't usually take a lunch break. I'll sit at my desk, eat my lunch, and go through some more emails and add, no, I don't know what the fuck happened here, but this is some X P. Windows virus looking shit, and my computer absolutely fucked out. Anyway, it's now 3:30. And have another meal after this. I had a meeting with a team. I did not film, but, uh, yeah, that's a typical day. And, uh, love you guys. Bye.",7500000

Now, this whole situation really humbled me. It made me realise that comparing our problems to someone else's doesn't make it go away. But seeing how blessed you are to have a healthy body, to go to the gym, a healthy mind in order to work, is truly humbling. And I say this because your problems are never really that big. Take advantage of what you've been blessed with. Because gratitude and compassion are by far some of the most powerful qualities that a man can have.

And I had this friend, and I came to find out that he was ridiculing me behind my back about my videos. And that was quite hard to hear, because we've been friends for quite a few years, and I really trusted him. But five years later, my cringy videos allowed me to retire my mom and take me to places I'd never thought possible. But best of all, these videos have helped thousands, if not millions, think and approach their lives differently. And if I'd listened to his words and stop making myself improvement videos, none of that would have happened. When you're chasing your dreams, remember this. Some people just won't support you.

So starting off with the most expensive, this is girl on Head Best Trouble aunties. And it's green, it's fresh. Performance wise it's actually pretty decent, but it is expensive. And next up is probably my most complimented fragrance. It's meteor by Louis Vuitton. It's not cheap, but it's very powdery, clean, fresh, and you will get complimented. Next up, this is probably one of my favourite fresh fragrances. This is PDM Sedley. It's fresh, it's citrusy, it's fizzy. It's almost like you went into a McDonald's on a summer day. Hundred degrees Fahrenheit and you got yourself a McDonald's Sprite. Now we get to the cheaper side of things. This is why I sell myself EDP. It is soft, clean. This is probably the most versatile one on this list cause you can actually wear this not just at the gym, but for a nice little date. And now the cheapest on our list Afnan electric clean. It's blue, best bang for your buck. It's even shaped like a torso so now you have no excuse to smell terrible at the gym this summer.",7500000

So when I sent my car in for a service last week, and my mechanic calls me, and he's like, yo, no. Did you take all the bolts off your exhaust? Because they're missing. And I was like, uh, no. That's pretty weird. So turns out, after an entire year of having this exhaust, I've never really heard what it sounds like because it was never fucking attached.

Now, let me explain. So three months ago, my energy drink brand, rise, launched in 7 11 as a test. We were up against two other brands in two states, and if we outsold the two other brands, we'd get into every store in the country, which is huge. Now, we didn't have a huge marketing machine behind us. We pretty much had myself and our community. And you guys showed the fuck up. You posted, you supported, and you asked, how can we help? So someone said, go to every 7 11 in Chicago, buy the drinks and hand them out. So we ran to the party bus, we crammed as many people in there as we could, went to a bunch of 7 elevens, and bought almost every drink that we could. Then we went and we had a public meet and greet, bringing a bunch of new traffic to a gym that I just opened. And it was absolutely insane. The community came together. I didn't sleep for 24 hours, but we made some incredible memories, and we helped out a new gym. But we still don't know if we won 7 11, because at the end of the day, 7 11 is a multi billion dollar company, and naturally, these things take a little bit more time. But it does seem like we winning. But now we're in another fight again, this time with Walmart in Texas, Arkansas, Florida, and Missouri. And now, even if we don't win 7 11 or the new Walmart challenge, I just want to do something equally as cool and memorable for the community. So, guys, what do we do? How do we make this Walmart campaign even more memorable? I just want us all to win this and write the next chapter together.",7500000

And now I understand why. A few years ago, my friend had to get shoulder surgery three times. When he asked the surgeon why this kept happening, the doctor told him something quite crazy. Sleeping on your stomach with your arm bent overhead puts hours of pressure on your shoulder joints, especially if you lift weights. At first I thought this was a stretch, but this position compresses your rotator cuff and bursa. And if your shoulders are already inflamed from training, those nightly hours of pressure only accelerate the wear. Well, I don't want to scare you. These small actions add up over the years. So try sleep with your arms at your side because it may save you some future pain.",7500000

Then I have to inject something else, and then I have to inject again. This is an intense course that I've had to do of antibiotics, because post surgery, I got an infection. And result of this, basically a tube that goes all the way up my shoulder and into my chest towards my heart. I cannot lift anything heavier than 10 pounds. And now, very fortunately, and finally, this comes out of my arm on Monday, which means I can go back to the gym. So, to answer your question, my arm is okay.

You complete sound like you were born in the U S A. Ouch. But I get it. I get it. Um, quite frankly, it's been very nice having my mother here from South Africa, because I think has brought back a lot of South African accent into my vocabulary. But there's something called subconscious accent reprogramming, and it's a real thing, because when I started coming to the United States, a lot of people simply could not understand what I was saying. And I'll find myself just pronouncing certain words or manipulating the pronunciation of words so that I could be understood. And I could go to a coffee shop or go to a restaurant. I could actually get what it is that I wanted off the menu. Simple things like water, ranch dressing, these sort of things where I would often be looked at and sometimes even laughed at because they didn't understand what I was saying. So to avoid that, and even when it comes to my name, people are asking my name. My name is quite simply Noel, but I always hear this, huh? So I'd have to say, my name is Noel. So, yeah, I would like to hold onto my accent. I do think I like. I do think it makes me very unique. But other than that, I'm surrounded entirely by Americans and American accents, and that may have had an effect on how I pronounce certain words.",7500000

But if you have any ideas what to do with all this space, please let me know, because that would be pretty cool.",7500000

This may be a little bit biased because I am an owner of this brand. First of all, it comes in 15 incredible flavours. We have the licenses with the likes of Sour Punch, Country Time, Kool Aid, Jello, ring pops, sunny D. We got great, great flavours. Taste is important, but what also is important is the ingredients. Citrulline, 4,500mg. You're gonna get a nice sick, crazy pump in the gym. Beta alanine, performance, endurance. Also, it's the tingles. I like the tingles personally. It's indication pre workout is kicked in, it's time to get to work. Plus our caffeine. So you gonna get that boost of energy. 300 mg caffeine and a Hydro. Number one selling pre workout on the TikTok shop. Excellent daily driver. Value for money at under $1 per serving. Because right now, as I mentioned, it's 35% off.

I remember going to the gym when I did decide to start, and I used to look around and I used to kick myself and say, why did I not start earlier? Why did I not start this journey sooner?

And I don't wanna sound cliche saying that, but there really is no better time than right now. I don't want you guys to sit back.

But don't wait two years. Don't wait five years. Please don't wait 10 years, because you're deterring yourself. And then look back and say, oh, I wish I had.

How to tie a tie, how to shave. Today, I'm going to teach you something that's much more important than that. Never, ever lay a hand on a woman. Not when you're angry, when you're hurt, when you feel like you're losing control. Not ever. Being a man is not about how strong you are. It's about how you control that strength. You don't get respect by raising your voice. You don't get power by making someone feel small. You get respect by being calm when it's hard, by walking away when your ego wants to stay. I don't care what she said. I don't care how upset you are. Violence is never the answer. And if you've ever been in that situation where you felt the urge to lash out, I'm not here to shame you. I am here to tell you you need to get help. That anger is a reflection of something much deeper. And real men handle what's going on inside before it destroys what's outside. And if you ever needed someone to say this to you, let it be me. You are not weak for walking away. And you're certainly not soft for controlling your anger. You're not less of a man for choosing peace. You're more of one. Now go and be that man.",7500000

So I started the process and we had a bunch of delays, and people just genuinely could not understand why I wanted this car. But this isn't about what's trending or flashy. It's about building what's an extension of me. But after months of planning, part sourcing, and incredible work from reserve customs, piece by piece, it all came together. Well, here it is. We went with the Basalt wrap. We blacked out everything that was chrome. We got new fog lights, new headlights. We got the new roof markers. We got these massive meaty Nitto tires. These are the Recon grappler. These gorgeous 4 play rooms. Yes, the name still, I don't get it, but 4 play and they make good ass rooms. Just come and look at the back. It's absolutely gorgeous. We got these tail light guards. I guess it's not for everyone, but it's built for one person, and that's me. Whatever you're building, your body, your brand, your life, don't rush it.

And what better way to kick this off than with some frequently asked questions? So let me get straight into it. Question number one. How long have you been lifting for? I was a bit of a late bloomer. I got into this about the age of 23, and I have been lifting for 17 years. I just gave away my age. Number two. How much did you weigh when you started? Bit of a running joke. I refer to myself as the ramen noodle of human, uh, of human form. And I weighed about 68 kilos, which is about 140 pounds. What is your height? I am 188 centimeters, or 6 foot 2 5. Are you natural or enhanced? So there's no secret about this? I've been very transparent. I am enhanced. No. 6. What's your training split right now? Due to my recovery, I'm not following any active training split right now. Instead, I have just while E M S. I was hooked up to this. Prior to start filming, I was in a cut, and during my cut, I was running a bro split. No. 7. How often do you train per week? I try and make sure that I'm training at least five days per week. Um, this is all centred around how many rest days. And I try and make sure that I have a minimum of one rest day per Week, with up to two rest days per week. So five on days and two off days. Number eight. What's your favourite muscle group to train? So when I started, it was arms and chest, because I looked good, good in a T-shirt. Now, the only answer that I could give you is every single muscle group, because I've trained myself to enjoy training every single muscle group, including legs. Number nine. Uh, what's your least favourite muscle group to train? There is no least favourite muscle group to train. Um, No. 10. What's the most important lift in your opinion? I'd have to say compound. No. 11. Do you count your calories or macros? Absolutely, yes, I do. Uh, right now I have been in a calorie surplus, but I do count my calories and macros. No. 12. What do you eat in a day? It's a very simple diet, but typically oatmeal, whey protein, almond butter, blueberries, ground beef, rice, broccoli, chicken, cream of rice, and some cottage cheese and other vegetables. And that's not all at once. That's over different meals. Um, No. 13. Do you do cardio? I do cardio almost every single morning. I do fasted cardio. I actually have my peloton right here. One of the best investments that I have made. No.14. How do you stay motivated? Very simply, dedication. Discipline equals results. And nothing's gonna motivate you more than results. Next question. What supplements do you take daily? All of the Above, um, actually, a kind of. This company rise. And my daily supplement stack would be whey protein, creatine monohydrate, uh, pre workout of choice, and some E A's. Final question. How long did it take you before you started seeing real progress? I don't know. I honestly, it was so long ago, I cannot for the life of me remember. Um, I was very skinny, and I was just eating. I was consuming food. Eat big to get big. That's all I knew.

As a lot of you will remember, around two years ago, I had surgery on my stomach, and that was for my hernia and diastasis recti. Basically, I had a tear in my abdominal wall, and it had to be repaired. Well, that entire surgery was a failure. And today I have to go in for corrective surgery, and it's a little bit more complicated. I don't wanna over dramatize this or be negative, because my previous surgery's recovery was just traumatic. Two weeks after my surgery, my friend Joe passed away. And shortly thereafter, I noticed problems. I don't wanna be too visual, but I had a hole in my stomach leaking plasma 24 7. I went to multiple doctors, and I tried so many different methods to close this hole. Around two weeks later, I went for an M R I, and I had an allergic reaction, and the results showed that I still had a tear in my abdominal wall, which meant the surgery was a failure. And at this point, I was really fucking down in the dumps. My good friend just passed away. I'm moving country in a few weeks, and I just went through so much pain and discomfort for seemingly nothing. Fast forward. I'm now in the United States. I've been to around nine doctors to figure out what's going on. I tried Treatment after treatment, and I was told nothing but bad news. So I went for another surgery, as you guys remember. Finally, we had some success, but that surgery was just to stop the leaking because nothing else worked. But now my abdominal wall is still messed up. I don't even have the confidence to take my shirt off. Now, almost two years later, and I can't even count how many doctors I've been to by this point. But I'm hopefully going in for the last time to fix this mess. Now. This hasn't been easy for me to talk about for the longest time, simply because I haven't had a true solution, but tomorrow seems like the end of the tunnel. There is a lot more to the story, so if you guys want to hear more, I posted it here. But thank you guys so much for being part of this journey.",7500000

A lot of the parts just don't fit. We order them, we return them, and we completely behind schedule. Now, at this point, I could have just bought something easier or even something newer, but that's not what this car is about for me.

Now, as ridiculous as that may sound, my mother lives by this and eats ice cream every single day because for her, it's the last connection to her father, who she loved dearly.

But at the same time, I don't wanna take ice cream away from her. So I'm making her my version of ice cream, but it's protein style without all those calories and sugar. But we have a problem.

Obviously you're a bit nervous, but this is whey protein. No ways it's whey protein. We put a little bit of milk in there and we made homemade ice cream, and we just put it into this container to fool you. You kidding? There's no ways. This is like the bought stuff. Ha ha! Yeah.

I explain myself and let's take photo number 5. I that one looks like she doesn't look like my aunt I don't know this one it's very weird that makes me feel uncomfortable I am not afraid if he sees me if one of my compas sees me like this is that no mames yes he does look like one of my compas eh eh I wouldn't be that scared but what I would be afraid of would be why you see me like this. what are your intentions with me no it looks as if he wants to stick his finger in you okay here we are already talking about something that is scary if you have seen the movie. you will understand me although according to me that spirit did not do much or did no however we will not remove the fact that it is scary. it's scary if I fuck myself let's put it in two because I don't know what I'm going to get after this. I hope something that is really scary ah bastard not fair I don't know what that fart is but I believe that would be the new film of the incantation or I don't know if it's already a movie, I really have no idea but since I've been watching that movie. jeta on my feet no mames me cago and he also has yellow eyes, gÃ¼ey no, that bato does not bring him or his liver, he does not bring this guy well. not one of course I'll fuck you and I think it was pretty close as well I made the right decision",5000000

El respeto de enfrentar lo imposible. Me subí al ring con 25kg y 10 cm de diferencia, no por ego, sino por coraje. Porque hay batallas que no se miden por el resultado, sino por el riesgo que estuviste dispuesto a tomar para crecer.  Desde mi corazón siento que decepcione a muchas personas que creían en mí pero principalmente a mi mismo. Porque sé que podía dar más pero los nervios, la presión y las cámaras y un estadio lleno de gente hacen que todo se sienta 1000 veces más difícil. Y vivir eso por primera vez también fue increíble. Esto NO es una excusa. Mi rival y amigo es una persona increíble, preparada, disciplinada y buena en el deporte y eso hace que su victoria sea justa. Como dije una pelea difícil. Y vivir esto a su lado lo hace aún mejor. Aveces también hay que ser un buen perdedor y aceptar que si no se ganó me faltó un mejor desempeño. Hoy reconozco mis fallos con humildad, porque solo quien acepta lo que debe mejorar puede avanzar de verdad. No busco venganza ni demostrarle nada a nadie… dicho esto he decidido seguir intentando por amor a este deporte, No por aplausos ni validación, sino para confirmarme a mí mismo que tengo el valor, la disciplina y el corazón para convertirme en una mejor versión de mí mismo. A partir de hoy quiero dominar la presión, la gente y los nervios de una pelea, dicho esto empezaré a prepararme para competir no en un evento mediático lo cual fue increíble vivir y agradezco la oportunidad pero si en una federación de boxeo. Dejando en claro que no dejaré de lado a lo que ya me dedico pero si abrir una puerta más en mi vida como atleta  Gracias por su apoyo, por su amor, por confiar en mí a pesar de todo y por nunca dejarme abajo padriniza.

No. 1. A routine. No. 2. Stick to your non negotiable. No. 3. Balance. Routine. Have a routine you know you can stick to no matter what. Remember progress over perfection. Find a time you know you're gonna wake up at least 60% of the time. These gonna help you have a structure to your vacation. Stay on track and win your morning. You're non negotiable. Get a hotel that is close to a gym. At least you can get your workout in the morning. This is done, this is behind. Then you can enjoy. Hey, doing 10,000 steps is pretty easy on vacation. Balance. You wanna enjoy, you wanna have a little cake, you wanna go out, have a little drink, right? And this is what it calls vacation. Find the right balance. If you stick to No. 1 and No. 2, you're already winning. And you won't feel guilty when you're gonna have a little cake or a little drink because you stick to your non negotiable. Remember, it's a lifestyle you created. It's not just a moment in the year. Right. If you stick to all these three points, I guarantee you that you will stay on track even on vacation. If you really want to learn more about how to implement that in your lifestyle, create the right plan for you and especially the right mindset with the right habits. You can DM me Improve. We'll have a little chat. And if I see that you really want this, we're gonna work together. And I guarantee you that if you stick to the plan, your vacation will not be the same anymore.

I’m not saying I fully enjoy it, but the feeling after finishing a run is just amazing. Since I’ve combined running with my gym workouts, I’ve developed better stamina, improved cardio (of course), and… I can eat more. Now, you don’t have to add running to your routine to lose fat. What really matters is understanding the science of nutrition. A lot of my students come to me worried that we’ll force them to do tons of cardio—but it’s not a must.

Because you go to the gym like a kid in the park that don't even know what to play. What you gotta do is focusing on progression overload. But what does that mean? Either you increase the reps, the weight, or the sets. Here's an example. Monday you do dumbbell curls. Three sets, 10 reps, 25 pounds. The next Monday, you will add 10 pounds each, but keep the reps and the sets. But hey, the workout is the easy part. The real reason why you still have your fat belly is because you are not focusing on your nutrition. And that's why everybody is failing. But don't worry, I got you. Focus on being in calorie deficit. It means that you are burning more calories than what you are consuming. First of all, you need to find your TDEE, which is your total daily energy expenditure. Is the amount of calorie you need to maintain your weight. Once you have this number, you remove between 300 to 500 calories, and you have the amount of calorie you need per day to lose weight. Example, my T D E E. Is 3,000 calorie per day. So if I want to lose weight, I need to eat about 2,500 calories. And I'll be losing weight super easily while maintaining my energy. What is amazing is that when you calculate your food, you know exactly what you Need to eat. And then you can start enjoying more of the food. Maybe once, twice, a few times a week. And have a cheat meal. If all this information is still Chinese for you and you need guidance, DM me. Ready? And we get to work.",4000000

Because we see a lot of content creators who are young, becoming very successful, flaunting this lifestyle with the super cars and the penthouses and all that stuff. And that's what young person is very appealing. But I promise you, if that's your driver want to become more successful, you were going to be left unfulfilled. The real reason why I personally now chase after success and making more money is because I wanna bless those that I love. When I bought my dad his dream car, cash, versus when I bought my dream car, it was way 10,000 times more fulfilling. It made me feel so good about life. I'm like, wow, this was so much more worth the grind and the hustle doing that for him than doing it for myself. On top of that, time is a limited resource that you cannot buy back. As soon as you have freedom with your time, that is more valuable than any type of supercar. Right? When I can go to every single kid that I have eventually is like football practice, drop them off at school, pick them up, spend every living, breathing moment of the rest of my life with my family and those that I love. And money will allow Me to have the ability to do that, that is a motivating ass driver that makes me wanna get up every morning and get after it. Right? Not the to buy. I mean, obviously the court, the cars can be cool, but that. Just understand that lifestyle, the Miami light, whatever, that. That's not. That should not be your driver. That shit is surface level as hell. There's no real meaning and value to it. And it's gonna be leaving you unfilled. Chase after deeper meaning and you'll find that your.

Here's some making a stupid purchase, laughing at me. Apparently I'm gonna have a downfall after I buy this crib. I don't understand about this thing. Here's. Here's another one. Ha ha ha. This guy definitely took his time on this one. Apparently, I'm not allowed to buy anything because people are in poverty. So therefore I should also, I guess, be in poverty. I don't know what he wants me to do. Then you get people like this, right? And this is where I'm gonna get to my little educational point here. When someone is more successful than you, there's two ways you can go about it. You can look at them, you can get inspired and motivated and try and get value from that person's success. Or the other end, you can self sabotage your own life by trying to bring someone else's success and bring them down to just invalidate their success to make you feel better about being at an inferior point in life, which is perfectly fine. But again, the same situation, two people are able to get something completely different from it. One gains motivation, the other literally does. Gets Gains nothing. Right. And I believe the one who gains motivation is inspired by others, other people's success. And doesn't, you know, talk shit or try and pull them down. That type of person is the one who is going to be successful.",2800000

I've talked to my spiritual leaders and stuff, those who baptized me in the ones that I have currently in my community in Nashville, and everything's leading towards a confirmation of me getting this crib. Um, and it's pretty freaking insane. It's the biggest decision I'll ever make. And I'm not making decision just for myself, and I'm making It for that family that I don't really fully have yet. I look at that dining room table in there, I'm like, man, I can't wait to have little freaking Alex is like sitting here and this is gonna be the place where they establish their life. And yeah, it's just an unreal thing to think about how god has just tremendously blessed me time and time again. Me, a sinner who is deserving of nothing, but he chooses to give me everything.

I recommend picking like a pec deck fly, doing two sets, 20, 25 reps before you start your workout. you'll feel your chest activate more once there's blood already in it. point No. 2 is gonna be exercise selection. I stay away from barbell now. I think that they're not optimal. I think it's better to do plate loaded presses, plate loaded flies, cable flies. you're gonna feel your pecs work a lot more, and it's safer to go to failure. point number three is simplify it. focus on progressive overload. get stronger in three to four movements. that's all that you need to grow.",2800000

When your arm is traveling in front of your body, jamming your elbow down. These are peak. Now lately the metacon has patch these. But still this is what I really built my back off of. This is a alternative. You can do a chest supported barbell row. It's probably more optimal, less fatiguing. I like to incorporate at least one more horizontal pulling movement where I really jam on my lower lat plate. Loaded horizontal rows. Fire.

I go to an amazing church, and it's not denominational. I love It. But I do feel like I've been missing out and lacking.

So you dumb idiots don't realize you're literally progressing the cause of what he would preach. Besides that, it's made me realize how sad our society is. The fact that people can so easily just degrade this person, his family, his wife, all this up because of a political belief that they didn't believe in and they're glorifying it has shown me how far society has fallen away from god.

Every single day that I'm working out, whatever muscle group that I'm hitting, I make sure to hit two to three exercises for that muscle group. The first set I always use is a feeder set, which just like a lightweight set. Warming up 20, 25 reps, get blood in the muscle, followed by two working sets to failure in the six to nine rep range. So day 1, chest, back and arms. Day 2, I do legs with a quad focus. Day 3, I do back and arms and delts, but a rear delt, side delt focus. Day 4, rest day. Day 5, chest and delts with a front delt and side delt focus. Day 6, arms. Day seven, legs with the hamstring focus. Day 8, rest day. Now this has worked great for me and my weak points.

They're super lightweight. They're baggy. You see how the arms are super baggy out here, which I like. Gives you, like, a good boxy fit. Drop shoulder. Again, everything's very similar to different. This depends what you want. You want shorts, you want a hoodie, you want pants. That one looks good.",2800000

We, as finite human beings, tend to focus so much selfishly on short term things of what we want, rather than God's bigger plan. The way I would explain, it's like imagine putting together a jigsaw puzzle. We as fine human beings, try to place this piece of the puzzle in our life story, and it won't fit where we're trying to fit it, where God's able to come take that piece. Who sees the bigger picture? Sees the infinite and is able to place it right where it's meant to be. So my biggest reason for why I'm making this is just trust in god.

You gonna be sitting there happy, right? You say you wanna win, but then you scared to lose. What sense does that even make? Look, you can't talk about wanting to win and then be scared of the risk. That's not how this works. If you lock in, keep your head down and stay focused on the vision, how could you not win? The only thing that's gonna make you lose is your own mindset. And that's all on you. Your biggest enemy ain't out there, it's in your head. So if you wanna win, you gotta get out of your own way. And here's the truth, every time you doubt yourself, you're slowing down your own progress. You either believe in yourself or you don't. There's no in between. If you keep second guessing everything, you're already losing. But when you stop playing scared and start moving like you're built for this, you'll see everything change.

Recently, I was looking to buy a car and I really wanted an RS five. So I started looking, like, daily for RS fives. I would look on Manheim, I would look on, like, different dealerships. And since then, I have seen so many RS fives out on the road where I feel like I never saw them before. It's not that there's more RS fives out on the road, it's the fact that my subconscious mind is being wired almost to keep looking for them. So when you're looking for the good in life, when you're looking for opportunity in life, and you teach your brain to recognize that and to realize that and to live it, over time it becomes subconscious to where your brain automatically looks for the good in things, automatically looks for the positive things, automatically looks for things that's gonna get you closer to the goals and the desires that you wanna live for yourself.",2800000

Even breaking up your sitting throughout the day with body weight squats like this is proven to help your blood sugar and metabolic health. Squats build muscle, bone density and resilience in your hips, knees, spine and core, the very foundation of movement. So master the move you are born to do. Squat now, strength later.

You don't need more motivation. You need to retrain your brain. With every rep, every glass of water, every time you choose discipline over dopamine, you're not just changing your body.

I did four sets of eight because this bag was super heavy for these. And now once I figured out how to place the bag on my back, I went on to perform Bulgarian split stance squats. I did three sets of 16 and then Bulgarian split stands. Good mornings to squat again. Three sets of 16 for these as well.

Guess what? It's in the muscle size and strength of your legs. Researchers have found that people, especially women, with stronger legs have a larger hippocampus. That's the area in the brain that regulates memory, learning, and emotional regulation. In one longterm study of twin females, the twin with stronger legs had better cognitive function. Ten years later, same genes, same environment, leg strength was the difference. Why? Because working out your legs, amongst other things, improves circulation, releases brainderived growth factors, and reduces agerelated brain shrinkage. So train your legs. This isn't just leg gains. It's brain gains.",2600000

It's about building an engine that lasts. Interval training, lifting, walking uphill. Those are just some of the ways that you can boost your VO2 max.

It's in the strength and size of your legs. Studies show that leg strength is directly linked to longevity. The stronger your legs are, the lower your risk of injury, disease, and even early mortality. People with larger thigh muscles have a lower chance of developing heart disease and metabolic disorders. Why? Because stronger legs means better circulation, faster metabolism, and greater mobility as you age. So every squat, every lunge, it's not just about today. It's about future proofing your body. So start training your legs, because your longevity starts from the ground up.",2600000

One of the most common mistakes I see people make is not going low enough. It’s easy to get in the habit of only squatting to parallel, but to get the most out of the exercise, you need to go deeper. Another mistake is letting your knees cave in. This can cause serious injury if left unchecked. To fix this, focus on pushing your knees out as you squat 🏋🏾‍♀️  Finally, make sure your back stays straight throughout the movement. If you start to round your back, you’re putting unnecessary strain on your spine. Keep these tips in mind, and you’ll be on your way to perfect squat form.

Beyond aesthetics, here’s why they’re a must in your workout routine: 🌟 Increased Arm Strength: Bicep curls are a go-to for building strength in your upper arms, enhancing your overall physical capability. 🌟 Improved Grip Strength: As you curl, you naturally engage your forearms, contributing to better grip strength—beneficial in various daily activities. 🌟 Versatile Exercise: Whether with dumbbells, barbells, or cables, bicep curls offer versatility, allowing you to tailor your workout to your preferences and equipment availability. 🌟 Functional Fitness: Strong biceps play a role in numerous daily tasks, from lifting groceries to carrying bags. Bicep curls help enhance your functional fitness. Now, to maximize these benefits, avoid these 5 common mistakes: 1️⃣ Eccentric Excellence: Slow down for optimal muscle growth during the lowering phase. 2️⃣ Strict Form Wins: Opt for seated curls to maintain precision and effectiveness. 3️⃣ Elbow Control Matters: Keep focus on your biceps by controlling your elbow positioning. 4️⃣ Ditch the Swing: Mirror check! Control the movement, engage your core, and reduce weight if needed. 5️⃣ Wrist Wisdom: Safeguard your wrists with controlled motions throughout the exercise.

Business is called interactive. If you haven't heard of it. Now you know about it. When I told people that I was gonna launch this brand, majority of the people I told told me not to do it. They said that the market was already too saturated and that they didn't think it was gonna make sense for me. And also bear in mind, I didn't have much business experience. Actually, I come from two immigrant parents who had zero understanding about business and finances. But what I did know is that I knew what I wanted and I knew what was missing for women in the market. And I specifically knew exactly how the product should feel, perform and look. And that's what I went and did. Last week I got invited to the house of Commons. You know why? Because my business was in the top 100 fastest growing independent companies in the UK. Privately owned, privately funded. Point being, sometimes other people set our limitations for us. We think we can achieve beyond the stars, but other people make us feel like there's a lid that's just top to things. And I'm here to remind you that if anyone around you makes you feel like the limitation, you are not the limitation, they are. You need to remove them out of your life and you need to keep on doing what you want to do. To my TikTok, gals. There you go.",3300000

But there is a reason. It all started when I was 5 years old. My Albanian parents decided to immigrate to the UK. Making our way on a tiny boat as a refugee and in the back of a banana truck. Don't even ask me why it was a banana truck. I still remember feeling cold and confused in the back of the truck, wondering what adventure we were gonna go. Little did I know my life would never look the same. But naivety is bliss. Like most, my parents grew up not having a lot. My mom and dad work three jobs and oftentimes I'd school and even go and help my mum clean offices after hours. I grew up with my mum saying Christiana, you better be the hardest working person in the room. Ever since then, kinda stuck to me. Being a 1st gen comes with a lot of responsibility. From grinding to get my law degree in university whilst working as a waitress, to starting my first brand on my university laptop I bought with my student loan. The bottom line is I fundamentally wanna make my mum and dad proud. I grew up no business, there's no mentor, no financial experts around me. Often times I'm pretty scared to lose it all. And I admit that the overworking is simply a response to my trauma. To help me Handle the fear of losing everything I've worked for and going back to being that five year old refugee girl in the back of a. My biggest achievement today, minus having my son, is not my businesses or the awards I've won. It's a fact that I got to retire my parents and buy them their very first home. It was a fact that my mom never has to worry and regardless of any family domestics, I'll always take care of. The responsibility often feels heavy, but you see, I have no choice as the safety that I have is the one I was never given. And I'm just simply trying to build my own.",3300000

Point being we often tell women to not move when they are pregnant and I do not agree with that UNLESS you have been advised by your professional to not lift! Or if you’ve never lifted before I would not suggest starting when you’re pregnant. Lifting weights helps with muscle mass/ development and body composition. I have been training 10 years before I fell pregnant/ during and 6 weeks after I gave birth. This is absolutely not to make you feel “bad” and I’m sorry if it does! This is to squash all the negativity around lifting / pregnant women lifting and the negativity around pregnancy ruining your body.  If you’re unwell, tired, need to rest then please do just that!

As someone who is literally about to give birth at any point, this is gonna be a little bit too much information. But I feel like I really wish someone had just told me the truth. So I have mentally prepared about it a little bit more. Why does no one tell you how big your nipples get? When were we gonna share that information with each other? Girl, you're about to have space shuttles as nipples. The second thing. When you enter your third trimester, you will be walking and peeing. Walking and peeing. It is not under control. Hmm. You are not gonna know what mood you're in that day. Sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're sad. Most of the time you'll be crying. Now, this was pretty normal for me, cause I'm pretty erratic like that with my emotions as it is. All I'm saying is, if you were a crazy bitch before you were pregnant, you have a little bit more crazy when you are pregnant. Ah, the final thing I would probably say that took me by surprise. You will be farting a lot more. You know what? It's okay. It's the baby. Just blame the baby. You hear a fart, it's the baby. You smell a fart, it's the baby. It is what it is.

After suffering with acne for 12 years of my life the one brand I truly have loved for the past 2 years has been @Allies of Skin  Everyone is talking about how incredible their product are and how well thought out they are. I never like working with brands who don’t care about their communities and allies really does. My top products would be: Their firming oil and of course the hyaluronic acid which I use for my belly also to avoid stretch marks. The also have a night cream in a new formulae available in two strengths: 00.5% & 0.1% which is 30% gentler and 11x faster acting than retinol that’s the product I fell in love with at the start but now can’t use it until baby boy is out!

You can use coconut oil, shea butter. I have this one from Lush Cosmetics, and I literally rub it all over my belly. Step No. 3. If you're feeling itchy or tight, this is gonna be your best friend. I use this for my face, so I thought I might as well use it for my belly. And it is so soothing and calming. And I put it exactly where it feels tight or uncomfortable or itchy. The final step is a heavy duty cream. You want something rich that also smells good and just really thick. Just gonna lather that on. Just put that everywhere, babe. That's it. That's the routine. Incredibly excessive. But you know what keeps the belly hydrated? And honestly, avoid me itching it, because I'm starting to get very itchy. Very, very, very itchy. So I hope it helps.

And not only do I have one wardrobe that looks like this, I actually have two wardrobes. Now, we're not judging, you know, I'm not rubbing it in your face or anything, but I do have two wardrobes, and that's because I'm absolutely addictive to activewear, and you guys already know I have so much activewear. So before I panicked, I reminded myself how lucky I am to even have a wardrobe and have my dream house. Because 10 years ago, do you guys remember that I was waitressing and studying for my law degree, and I was stressed out and I didn't even actually know what to do with my life? And the fact that I get to organise my clothes I bought with my own money literally blows my mind. Because, you guys, I never thought I'd ever be here. And this is just your reminder, honestly, that when someone tells you not to go and do something, and someone tells you that your dream is cringey, or you shouldn't be posting on social because it's awkward, or if someone has anything negative to say, just remind them, you know, one day, I'm gonna have my dream wardrobe, and I'm gonna clean my shoes and organise them. And even though it's Gonna be a daunting task to do. It's gonna be worthwhile because you made that happen for yourself. And so no one can tell you otherwise. So here's the end result. It looks absolutely sensational. I don't offer organisation services. But if I did, honestly. Ha ha. Call me. So that's it. In two months time, it'll look like it didn't stop. Bye.",3300000

A more beginner friendly hip mobility drill is called the hip airplane.

Follow this mobility drill with an exercise like the side plank clamshell. Held for five seconds to stabilize the hip joint.

Uh, she left me. Oh. But I got the van. It's nice. Stephanie had been dealing with back pain for months that limited her ability to squat and even lift this 135 pounds without symptoms. During my assessment with the single leg bridge test, she could feel her glutes firing really hard on her left side. But when she went to the right side, no glutes, just quads, hamstrings, and her groin muscles working hard. This meant she was dealing with gluteal amnesia, a phenomenon by which pain corrupts the body's signaling process, creating problems in timing, coordination, and intensity of muscle contraction for her, leading to problems in hip extension. So part of her back pain recovery required us to focus on the glutes and get them to fire better. We started with a double leg bridge with a band around the knees and paired this with the McGill big three core stability routine of 10 second holds. She then slowly rebuilt her lifts and was able to get back to lifting heavy weights again pain free.",3300000

If your only goal is to build shoulder size, there may be nothing wrong with partial pressing, but you should still have the ability to move through a full range if you want to maintain healthy, functional shoulders for life. And if you're like my patient, and I've already lost that ability, here's some things that may help. During my testing, I found he was tight in many directions, and if you can't externally rotate your shoulder, you can't move overhead. So here's the drill I gave him to restore this mobility. You start by contracting your internal rotators and then letting the band slowly pull you out into a good stretch. After we retested and saw good improvements, it then performed a landmine press with cues to focus on scapular upward rotation, which is key for overhead pressing.

Here's three exercises to unlock your stiff upper body. The first one is performed by the best male weightlifter in the entire world today. The light weights help pull into an excellent shoulder and chest stretch. Because his shoulders are off the end of the bench and lower back flat, he's able to mobilize his thoracic spine as well, which is key for a more upright torso and positioning the arms correctly. During his lifting, he makes a big arching motion with his arms before then returning to the start position. An easier version requires a stick in your upper back cantilevered over a foam roller. Raise your arms as high as possible and make sure your core stays engaged as arching the low back removes the stretch from your upper body. Another loaded version requires a light plate. Try to keep your arms straight and low back from arching as you raise the weight overhead, and take a few slow, deep breaths in the stretched position.",3300000

This all started after a past low back disc injury that created radiating symptoms down his left leg and continued to give him some back pain. During my testing, I also found he had a 20% difference in jump height and he felt far more unstable on his left side. Now, there's a phenomenon called gluteal amnesia by which pain corrupts the way the brain engages the glutes, which is why he felt his back only during these single leg bridges. However, adding a band around his knee was able to teach his brain how to re engage his glutes so he no longer felt his back on these anymore. We also did some single leg squats with pauses to enhance his single leg stability and control. This allowed him to jump higher with way less asymmetry.

A single leg bridge was easily felt in his glutes on his right side, but on his left he couldn't feel his glutes, but instead his hip flexors were working hard. Also notice how weak his left lateral hip was. Now when the body senses poor stability, it tightens up joints and creates stiffness.

However, it is an exercise that I have deemed crucial for hip. If you want to build a bulletproof groin or rehab a groin strain, you need to train your adductors. And the Copenhagen side plank is an amazing exercise for that. But for some, it could be too intense and even cause pain. So if this is you, here's three regressions to help you build up. The first is a double leg glue bridge, squeezing a ball between your knees. Hold this position for five to 10 seconds. The progression is. Then a single leg glute bridge. Hold this position, trapping a foam roller between your knee and the wall for five seconds. After mastering those, then try the Copenhagen Plank, but from your knees.

Did you see it? When the hands move overhead when lifting weights, the shoulder blades also move to support the arm. Notice how the bottom of her left shoulder blade is more prominent than the right. This means her scapula was shifted forward and tilting. And for three time Olympian Mirabai Chanu, it limited her ability to straighten her left elbow and caused wrist pain just two weeks before the world championships. Now two key muscles help prevent the shoulder blade problem. The serratus anterior anchors the shoulder blade to the rib cage and the lower trap pulls it downward keeping it from tilting forward. I gave her the landmine press, extending the elbow fully before then driving the rest of the press with the shoulder blade cueing to rotate the shoulder blade up and off the body. Retesting after showed great progress. So we kept this as a part of her warmups which allowed her to then lift pain free and secure a silver medal for India.",3300000

Reach your body away from the wall, round your upper back slightly, then feel your shoulder blades rotating up and off your body as you slide the roller up the wall a bit. You can also do this with a straight arm. Again, reach away round the upper back and rotate the shoulder blade up.

You're going to find a small box or stack of plates, and yes, you can hold on if your balance is very bad. You're going to start by hinging back and leaning your chest forward. This should engage your glutes. Then squat straight down, tap your foot, and come back up. The hip dominant start is what makes this exercise so much different than the way most people perform single leg squats. But engaged glutes and single leg control are key for healthy knees.

Listening to what your heart says. Strengthening key posture muscles on your back, for some, can be the key to unlocking tight shoulders and upper back and neck pain. Here's three more exercises you could add to that routine you saw at the start that helps accomplish this. You're gonna start with your arms in an L position. You're gonna raise and hold for three seconds. Then you're going to move into a Y position. This is particularly going to isolate the lower trap muscles, which are very weak often in many people that have tight shoulders and upper back and neck pain. After a few reps, you're then going to last move back into that L position and perform an overhead press. Now, you're doing this all on your stomach because you have the cue to not let your hands hit the ground. And in accomplishing this, all those muscles of your upper back are going to be working really hard. Try 10 reps of each for a three second hold at the end position.",3300000

In order to keep your body still and from twisting or bending as you lift one arm, multiple muscles across your entire body are going to kick on together and work in coordination in what's called your functional line. Now, in first performing, if you're unable to do it without your torso twisting like this, just widen your feet out a little bit more and that'll make it slightly easier. And rather than lifting your arms, another variation you can try is where you lift one leg while maintaining a front plank position. This variation is less difficult for your shoulder stability and more demanding for your hip and pelvis stabilizers. Both exercises maintain three points of contact on the ground, which helps support shearing loads on your low back, meaning some people who have back pain can still perform these core exercises.",3300000

Another way to make your wall sits harder. Do them single leg, push as hard as you can into the ground and you'll feel your quads start to fire like crazy. That patient of mine had a recent quad tendon repair. He could do knee extensions just fine until the last 10 degrees of extension. At this point it felt like his quad just turned off and if he did try to force it, he would get knee pain. That however, isn't just weakness, it's called cortical inhibition. After an injury, the brain acts like a dimmer switch turning down muscles to protect the joint. The muscles can fire, the brain just holds them back. Instead of pushing through a painful knee extension. I had him do a single leg wall sit which is pain free, knee bent at the exact same angle that he struggled with. After a few sets of 30 seconds his quad started to fire like crazy. The tough isometric told the brain it was safe and the muscles turned back up. After he could do knee extensions easier and Phil's quad working really well.",3300000

That's a weak disease. Hold on. Run up. If you're broken in my business, then just shut up. So she thinks her back pain is caused by an anterior pelvic tilt. This patient of mine actually had that problem. My testing showed loading her back while in a neutral spine posture by pulling up on this bench was completely fine. But the moment she arched her back and then pulled up, she got back pain. Spine flexion, no pain. But the moment she arched her back and standing, pain. And when squatting, she liked to arch her back, tipping her pelvis forward. And when she did that, it again created pain. So for her, back extension was her pain trigger. For others, a small amount of anterior pelvic tilt may be symptom free and not the cause of their back pain. But that's why we always assess. We never guess. So here's what I gave her. The midguilbake three core stability routine of 10 second holds in each of these three movements. And when under load, we focused on maintaining a more neutral spine with ribs stacked on top of the pelvis. This squat was now pain free.",3300000

Laying on her stomach, I pushed down on each individual segment of her low back. One segment I'd hit spark pain. This is because it was unstable. Yet when I lifted her legs off the ground, which created compression on that area, stabilizing the joint. So this time, when I pushed on it, there was no more pain. So she needed to stabilize her spine to heal her back pain. This isn't built with strength exercises, but instead drills like the McGill Big three routine and offset walks.

Are you frustrated when you see someone easily squatting deep like this? Do you feel like you fold in half no matter how hard you try to keep your chest upright? It's not your height, but your femur to torso length ratio. Here's two squat hacks to help. First, we concentrate on your ankles by either wearing a weightlifting shoe with a raised heel or by improving ankle mobility to get more knee over toe. A simple warm up you can do before you squat starts by grabbing a lightweight and then shifting your knee over your toe until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold for five to 10 seconds and do a couple on each side. You can also try a slightly wider stance and or opening up your hips up more as you descend. Doing so creates a posture adjustment allowing you to stay more upright and could create a more comfortable feeling squat.",3300000

Let me show you three ways to progress a single leg squat. If you're a beginner, try the touchdown.

Step 1. We assess your body. Take my patient Sean, for example. Every squat, he shifted to the right. During my evaluation, I found he lacked hip internal rotation on his left side. At home, you can test it like this. But that wasn't all. He also had a restriction in right side tibial rotation. So he shifted to avoid a hip impingement on the left and couldn't open his right because of his ankle. We then assigned specific corrective exercises based on the testing. I started with a joint mobilization to improve internal rotation and testing showed great progress. For his ankle, I used a drill where you trap a band under the base of your big toe, squeeze your glute to open your hip and hold for five seconds. This improves tibia rotation and testing. Agreed. Step 3, we integrate into loaded movement. We did slow tempo squats and as you can see, he's much more balanced now compared to the start of the day.",3300000

Hold for 10 seconds without letting your torso twist at all. Next up, the RDL. Now, understand the low back muscles have fibers that run at an angle towards the spine. Keep your back close to neutral and they work to keep your spine safe. Let your back round under load and they stretch out. Now, unable to hold off sheer load and injury risk increases. That's why it's not wise to do Roman chair back extensions with the rounded back. So keep your low back flat and move about your hips.

It's with pain. In fact, he could crank out chin UPS no problem, but with pull UPS, they created shoulder pain for the last three years. This isn't usually because the big muscles are weak, but rather the smaller ones next to the joint aren't controlling it well in testing. Agreed. He was unable to resist my pusher, showing limited external rotation stability. So to enhance this weak link, we started with seated external rotations. Slow tempo on the way down, pause at parallel, and then slow back up for 10 reps. Next up was a banded external rotation, trying to keep the elbow elevated as he rotated his hand back and again held in this position for five seconds. The hold is key because that's what enhances stability in joint control. After these, felt so much better.

But are you doing them right? Here's a three step process to learn them that I Learned from master kettlebell instructor Pavol. Before we grab a weight, we need to practice the back squat. Think butt, back and vertical shins. You should feel tension in your glutes and hamstrings if you're balanced correctly. Then powerfully pull your hips through and stand up. Next, try the towel swing. If you try to lift the weight with your arms, the swing will feel very off. However, if you move powerfully about your hips with straight but relaxed arms, the towel will stretch and your arms will form a straight line at the top, perpendicular to your extended body. Then start with the kettlebell in front of your body on the ground. Hike the bell between your hips before then driving your hips forward while keeping your arms loose. Keep your arms connected to your torso through the lats. On the way down. At the top, drive your feet hard into the ground and squeeze your glutes and ABS.",3300000

He couldn't squat without knee pain for the past year. His left hip mobility was great, but his right felt blocked. Pushing his knee to his chest during the Faber test, his left hip opened well, but his right hung in the air. So to improve his hip opening mobility, I gave him the kettlebell weight shift, which showed excellent results. To help with his hip impingement, he did a banded goblet squat, squeezing his glute to pry his hip open. Retesting after, he can now pull his right knee all the way to his chest without that block. And by addressing his hip problem of limited mobility and control, he's able to squat 155 pounds this day without any pain.",3300000

What am I? Besides starting with lighter weight, here's three mistakes to avoid if you want to do lateral raises correctly to build strong and muscular deltoids. Problem No. 1 using momentum and swinging the weight up. Drop your ego and the weight. Start in a stable position and control the weight up and down. You'll feel far more activation in your deltoids. You also don't want to drop the weights too quickly back towards the ground. This decreases the tension in your deltoids on the eccentric lowering phase of the movement, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the exercise for strength and hypertrophy progress. Instead, make sure that you still have constant tension on the way up and on the way down. Last, don't just think about lifting your elbows. This internally rotates the shoulder. Decrease the overall effectiveness of this exercise on building your deltoids. Whether you're doing this with a straight arm or a bent arm, think about raising the weight, not just your elbow.",3300000

I see hundreds of patients every single year with this type of injury when lifting. Like my patient Hayden, who had a pop when deadlifting. This method can teach you how to restabilize your spine, engage your ABS in a way that push your fingers out to the side. This is proper core bracing, and most people get this wrong. Many in the situation also benefit from specific corrective exercises designed to enhance the function of the small muscles next to the spine that control it to limit excessive or unwanted motion whenever we're lifting. For example, the offset walk is a great warm up you can do in this situation. Just 10 pounds hanging off of a light stick. Your body has to stabilize against the bouncing weight, teaching your core to stabilize your spine so you can stay safe when lifting.",3300000

The first is to enhance joint control, also called stability. Here's an example at the rotator cuff. A lot of people that develop shoulder pain when bench pressing have a problem in joint control. If you take a rotator cuff exercise and perform a three to five second pause with it, you enhance this joint control far better than just performing the motion up and down. Next, let's say you have a big breakdown in technique like this. We can use pauses to enhance movement control. Five second pause squats, for example, can build balance and stability to keep you from tipping forward on the way up. Last, let's say you have patellar tendinitis. That pain will limit the quads from firing optimally, called cortical inhibition. The isometric of a Spanish squat hold has been shown in research to not only decrease pain, but increase quad activation directly after.",3300000

If you just suffered a herniated disc, here's three crucial steps that may be very helpful for your recovery. First, we want to avoid bending our back when lifting things from the ground. For many with a disc bulge, this is a trigger for pain. This is because the combination of bending and load is what drives the herniation. Instead, we want to focus on hinging. When bending over, butt goes back, lean the chest forward. This keeps the spine in a more neutral posture, which more evenly distributes load. It doesn't drive that disc bulge. The many who have this intolerance to flexing often benefit from laying on their stomach a few times a day for two to three minutes. We then follow this with pain free, low load core stability exercises like the McGill Big Three routine of 10 second holds in each of these positions.

The truth is bunions aren't just a bump. They're a progressive dislocation of your big toe joint caused by wearing narrow shoes. Before modern footwear, your feet looked like this, very different from how many look today. Devices like these may stretch your bunion, but if you keep wearing narrow shoes, your toes will never spread back out. First, you need to ditch the bad shoes. Switch to wide toe box shoes so your toes actually have room. Next, use a toe spacer. I personally like the correct toes brand. Think of them like braces for your teeth, guiding your toes back into their natural shape. Then release your adductor hallucis, the muscle that gets shortened from years of narrow shoes with a little self massage. Finally, strengthen this weak muscle. Wrap a rubber band around your toes and do calf raises. This helps reinforce your new alignment.",3300000

This is a great exercise for working your lats, but if you're going to do them, don't make these mistakes. The first is using momentum to get the bar down. This is often seen in a lot of ego lifters that just want to move a lot of weight. Instead, stiffen your core, your lower body, and control the weight down through contraction of your back. The second most common problem is pulling that bar way too low towards your belly button like this. Instead, to use your back optimally, you want to pull that bar towards the top of your chest. And last, if you just pull with your arms rather than your back, you'll often see uneven shoulder blade positioning in the appearance, like you're shrugging during the motion. To learn how to pull with your back and optimize Lat engagement, we can break the overall movement down into two individual pieces. Master those, and eventually they flow together. So you want to think shoulder blades down and back, and then pull with your arms. This teaches you how to engage your back muscles first and then pull.",3300000

Her warm up wasn't preparing her to stabilize against these loads, so I changed it. I had her perform the McGill Big three core stability routine of 10 second holds in each of these positions, with cues to brace her core in a way that expanded her ABS laterally out to the side and maintain that contraction for the 10 seconds when retesting that prior painful lift.

Ribs flared and shoulders crunched together feels loose versus ribs stacked and core braced tight. Instead of thinking about your mid back, shift your focus to your lats, the real key to torso stiffness. Step 1 make your arms long with the cue shoulders down.

So to enhance shoulder joint control, we started with the external rotation w exercise of 5 second holds in the end range. We then move to an elevated position so that we can work the rotator cuff at an arm angle more specific to the lateral raise exercise. I cued her to slowly lower the weight to a parallel position and hold for a few seconds and perform 10 reps.

Are you hitting the bar forward on your lift like this? It may be because your deadlift has a problem. The bar is too far away. If you watch elite athletes perform a clean in slow motion, notice how close that bar is to their legs the entire time. If that bar gets away from them at the start, the rest of the lift can never be as balanced and efficient as it needs to be. So to fix, perform super slow deadlifts, feeling for that bar close to your body the entire time. Again, the idea is, we can't run before we learn to walk. Performing deadlifts like this builds muscle memory, so it transfers into your clean. Just check out the difference between these two lifts.

I wanna see the. The world when I stop. Here's what most people get wrong. On the side of your hip, there's two main muscles. The TFL, which he hypertrophied, and the glute medius. Now, most people are taught that the glute medius is just one muscle that moves your hip out to the side, but that's not true. The glute medius actually has three distinct parts, each with different fiber directions. Functionally, it acts like the rotator cuff of the shoulder. Its main job is to stabilize the hip joint. Now, the TFL can pull the leg out to the side, but it can't stabilize the hip joint. So if the glute medius isn't doing its job well, the TFL takes over, and that extra load gets transferred into the IT band, and eventually, pain can ensue. So while kickbacks may train the glute medius muscle, it's not training it in its true function as a stabilizer. That's why I like banded squats. It forces the glute to fire as a stabilizer, turning once painful squats pain free.",3300000

Take this patient of mine, for example, that came to me with shoulder pain when bench pressing. He told me he could never feel his lats working. A simple drill I gave him to figure this out started with light bands around his shoulders. By pulling down against that band resistance, the lats turned on.

The muscles can work, but the brain holds them back. So instead of forcing painful reps, we tried a weight bearing exercise. A single leg wall, sit, knee bent at the exact angle he struggled with. Suddenly, his quad fired without pain. That tough isometric told the brain it was safe, and the dimmer switch turned back up. Here's the cool part.

That's why the plank pull through, demonstrated here by Olympic and world champion Lu Zhao Jun, is a game changer. This exercise is low load on your spine, but high demand on your core. Because you always have three points of contact, you actually minimize sheer loading on your spine, meaning sometimes even the most irritated backs can perform this exercise. To perform, plant your arm, stiffen your core, and pull the weight across your body without allowing any twisting or bending from your spine.",3300000

In external rotation, not at all. But that's why we retest. Because I also found he was very weak with this lateral hip stability test. So I proceeded to give him side plank clam shells for a 10 second hold in the lock, clam belly button to the bed, only opening the hip for a three second hold after. His hip now move freely in both directions and he could cross his right leg without any pain. You see, sometimes the answer to limited motion isn't a mobility drill.

Now sometimes the answer to limited range of motion is not a mobility drill, but rather stability exercises that help us better control joint rotation. So I had him start with a side plank clamshell, driving his focus right hip off that bed as high as possible for a five second hold. He then performed a small single leg squat called a touchdown, hinging first until he felt his glutes, then squatting down until his foot tapped the ground and coming back up. 10 reps in total.

Your deltoid creates an upward and outward pull on your arm bone, whereas the rotator cuff creates an opposing inward and downward pull on that same bone. If a stronger deltoid overpowers a relatively weaker rotator cuff, you lose control of your shoulder joint and increase risk of injury. That's what happened to this patient of mine. He could not do lateral raises without shoulder pain. So I gave him this external rotation drill, keeping the elbow elevated, not full scapular retraction, and holding here for five seconds.

The grip, rotation and stability challenge of balancing the shields throughout the press is quite a unique strength challenge. Here Kelly is performing the traditional press (though there are a number of different variations)  Sang is one of the 4 traditional training tools used , along with calisthenics, in the ancient Persian/Iranian martial art known as Zurkhaneh Sport and is one of the world’s first strength training systems.  Large flat wooden shields, the sang (meaning “stone” in Persian) mimics the weight and form of battlefield shields once used by Persian warriors. Typically weighing between 15 to 60 kilograms, the sang shields are an integral part of Zurkhaneh training, combining physical strength with spiritual discipline and cultural heritage.

Today I'm going to share with you a secret to performing the clean like some of the top weightlifters in the entire world. Listen to the start of this lift. Do you hear the barbell hit the plates? That's an explosive pull. But this is wrong. Instead, you want to slow down and build the connection between your body and the bar. This is going to keep your body very tight for a very stable pull. Notice how the bar bends and then the plates leave the ground. Most people should not have an explosive start. We wanna save that power generation for later on in the lift. So it's controlled start, then power generation. Hope this can help you.",3300000

Even though research has shown wearing a weightlifting belt can help you lift more weight with more explosive power, there's still two reasons you should not wear one at times. First, a weightlifting belt is not going to save your back from injury if your technique looks like this. Instead, we need to first listen to the advice of this legendary powerlifter after he performed this 880 pound beltless deadlift. To first establish your natural weightlifting belt, we need lateral AB engagement. We then combine this with proper Lat engagement. So long arms brace the core, engage the lats for strong positioning. It's then important to have some non belted lifts within your training so you don't over rely on the passive stiffness it provides. But if you take this approach, when you do put that belt on, you'll find ultimate performance.",3300000

This patient of mine could easily raise his left leg, but on his right, instant pain in the front side of his hip. Issues like this often arise because there's a muscular imbalance of poor hip stability and glute control. Functionally. I test for this ability with the single leg squat, and because he never trained them, he had no idea just how bad his control really was. We worked our first day on rebuilding this ability with just a four inch box, hinging until he felt his glutes and then slowly squatting down until his foot hit the ground. This is called a touchdown single leg squat and after this was much better. So to keep your body functioning well and pain free, do your single leg squats.",3300000

Notice how there is a bulge on my right side and it's sticking up higher than my left side? If you notice, these muscles pop more on your problem side in the shoulder blade doesn't rotate upwards as much compared to your other side. Here's what could be going on. This is usually associated with over dominance in the rhomboid muscles, which is then often linked to under facilitation in the serratus anterior muscle that upwardly rotates the shoulder blade. Step one is some soft tissue work with a ball to that area that's often a little tender for about one to two minutes. We're then going to re engage the serratus anterior with a landmine press. But this isn't just a forward and back deltoid exercise. We're going to overemphasize upward rotation of the shoulder blade. So think, drive the shoulder blade up and off the body. Then don't retract your shoulder blades hard for now with other shoulder exercises, as that will continue with the compensation",3300000

I could easily push his left arm down towards the ground and with this external rotation test, his left side felt far weaker compared to his right. This meant he was suffering from a muscular imbalance where the muscles on the backside of the joint weren't doing their job correctly, leading to compensation and over recruitment of other muscles. I gave him three exercises, starting with this external rotation with a five second hold here, then a lateral arm raise, again with a five second hold in this position, and finished with an upside down kettlebell rotation, trying to keep the elbow underneath the wrist.

Why the hell am I squatting with my heels on a plate? Here's why Sam Sulek and other lifters squat with their heels on plates or with the weightlifting shoe. The most simple answer is that it changes technique. When you squat with your heels elevated, it allows more knee over toe translation so that you can squat deeper with a more upright chest compared to without elevation. Ankle mobility levels will dictate how much knee over toe motion you get and the angle at which your trunk assumes to stay balanced. Have less ankle mobility and you lean forward more. Doing so then shifts more of that load demand onto the hips. Whereas if you are more upright by elevating your heels, that load is more evenly distributed amongst hips and knees, and some people feel like it activates their quads a little bit more.",3300000

A row plus a side bend. You see, the lats run from your arm all the way down to your low back. When they contract, they can extend your arm with a pull up or a row, but they can also side bend the torso. By combining both of those actions, like this, in what's called the lock row, you can enhance that muscles activation to an even greater degree so that it can work better in the following exercise.

Sit, breathe. While not as violent, this college powerlifter would use a seated self decompression technique to adjust her back, but the relief she would get would only last about 30 minutes and she'd have to do it again. This is because a spine adjustment by itself does not fix the root cause of a back injury. For example, during my evaluation, I found her back pain wasn't as bad during squats, but as she tried to take steps back into the rack. However, if I cued her to brace her core in a way that pushed my fingers laterally, proper core bracing, she can now walk back into the rack without any pain, revealing a stability issue. So her spine, like this model shows, was moving too much in certain areas. To enhance spine control, I gave her the McGill big 3 core stability routine and followed it with shaky offset walks. 10 pounds hanging off of a PVC pipe down and back a few times and a few months later she's now back to lifting heavy weight again without any pain.",3300000

You don't like to dance? Come on, do the Cha Cha, shorty. Spanish, so she like to call me papa. Form strengthening can be helpful for fixing elbow pain. But let me show you what else may be needed for a comprehensive fix. My patient Jim came to me suffering from right elbow pain for nine months now. Tennis elbow is particularly painful with gripping. Not only did this hurt on his right, but he was about 40 pounds weaker. This injury also often responds well to a joint mobilization to take pressure off the irritated tissues and help the joint actually move a little bit more freely. The band is positioned under the elbow crease. You then pull your arm close to your body, so you have a lot of tension on the band, and if right for your body, gripping this time should be pain free. I had him do 10 to 20 of these in a row. We then did some banded work, as many elbow injuries have a root cause, all the way up at the shoulder. And finished with wrist extensions, both an isometric up here and a slow eccentric. Not only was this now pain free, but his grip strength came back, and curling was also pain free.",3300000

For most people, they're not the best way to train your core. If you want your ABS to show, that mostly comes down to lowering body fat. But if you want your core to do its real job, here's what you should do instead. Your ABS aren't just for looks. Their real purpose is acting like a transmission system, helping you generate more power through your arms and legs. Your core also protects your spine. It works to prevent excessive motion when you're lifting weight. Now, the spine is designed to move, but it's not designed to move a lot when lifting. That's why athletes try to maintain a neutral spine when deadlifting and stiffen their spine in place if out of neutral. Excessive spine movement under load in the long term is a bad idea. So instead of training spine flexion movement like sit UPS, train spine flexion moment resisting movement. One of the best exercises for this the stir the pot. It'll light up your six pack while teaching your core to stabilize your spine.",3300000

The couch stretch he's performing not only targets your quads, but also your hip flexors. Research demonstrates those who have tight hip flexors also often have inhibited glute muscles, which can hurt technique quality and increase risk of injury. Here's a slightly easier version of that stretch that's going to target the hip flexors a little bit more than the quads. When this weightlifter patient of mine tried it on his left, it was crazy tight, which is why when he did a single leg bridge on his right, he could easily feel his glutes. But on his left, just quads, no glutes at all. To perform the stretch, squeeze your glute and then lunge forward, then lean to the side. That should bring out an even greater stretch than just the lunge alone. For those who also have a side to side difference in tightness, like my patient, superset these with double leg bridges, squeezing your glutes as hard as you can for five seconds.",3300000

Not only did this hurt on his right, but his grip strength was about 40 pounds less. Now, this injury also often responds well to joint mobilizations. To take pressure off the irritated tissues, help the joint move more smoothly and reduce pain right away. You put the band just under the elbow crease, tension the band by pulling your arm close to your body, and then perform squeezes and curls. Because he also had an unstable right shoulder, possibly a root cause of his elbow pain, we then did external rotation stability drills, such as banded curls and presses.

When he did this on his restricted right side, he really felt a crazy hard stretch. After five reps for a five second stretch, we then did Bridges, 10 reps for a five second hold.

If you can combine those three, you have the class. So for 10 days, I spent teaching exactly that. It wasn't just me, though. I was putting every single one of them on the spot every single day, getting them complete, completely out of their comfort zones.

Before I taught the most intense pulse it out event on the farm. We had to feed the animals. I even ended up with 14 eggs for breakfast. I also went into the garden and I picked out two purple bell peppers so I ended up with the freshest breakfast ever. Today probably all seen normal cows, but we've never seen Scottish cows or Dexter cattle, so it was my first time seeing and feeding those cows today. Like I said in the beginning, it is farm. Now that we're done feeding all of the animals, this is where the fitness part comes. I posted posted out all over the world in so many different studios, but never on a farm and never this cold. I think the temperature was sixty, but muscles were shaking either way. After this it was time for my own workout. Now though, there's a full garage gym at this farm. I'm not talking small garage gym, I'm talking there was a lot of options. After a full day of farm tours and workouts, we hit up the sauna. I probably said I wasn't going in the cold plunge at least 20 times, but after feeling my body melt away in there, I decided to hop in. So if you ever thought what it's like to combine fitness and a farm, this is it.",780000

A pinch of salt, half a teaspoon of baking soda, one teaspoon of baking powder. This is our last step. Coconut flour, one dish dessert. So there's no extra dishes in here. Gently mix the batter, scoop everything into a dish. Now for my favorite part ever. Susan is so good at making an amazing strudel. I'm gonna show you exactly how. First we have almond flour. How much? About half a cup of almond flour. A good sprinkle of cinnamon, because there you go. Sue loves cinnamon. Allulose or monk fruit for your sweetener? Both. And monk fruit are a cleaner, 0 calorie sweetener, which I substitute for good. Half handful, heaping, heaping tablespoon. What is that? Coconut oil. How much? Like, take about a tablespoon. Now, We mix this all together to make our little streusel. Like it a little bit more clumpier. So we're gonna add a little bit more slowly. Add and see the kind of texture that you like. We're gonna take the crumble and place it on top of the streusel cake. That's it. Bake it for 45 to 60 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Alright, we'll see you when it's done.",780000

First off, you start off the morning with an early 8 and 9:00am Class, a double. I'm also meeting everyone new here because I'm not from Lebanon, I'm from Florida, but I flew all the way over here to host a sculpt teacher training. But what's a sculpt teacher training without sculpt classes? So over here we're banging out two in one. Then one thing that fills my own cup is going out to eat to keep pastry places and cafes. So, yes, that means I go out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But once it's 12:00, it's time to head over to go do teacher training. Day 2, which is one of the most important days during the 10 day workshop, started off with technical form, which LED to our verbal and physical correction, which makes this more hands on than just sitting there and learning. For example, each one of them had to correct my improper form. But the best part comes this one on one workshop, which helps the instructors figure out their energy and their method, their voice, what makes them unique and their kind of energy. During class with me, though, we never sit still. So we get straight back into moving, demoing, practicing, and putting every single instructor on the spot. Which is a love hate thing, but I am pushing these instructors out of Their comfort zone. And we're also creating such a tight community and bond because we've been spending five hours every single day together. Also seeing each and every single person's strengths and weaknesses. It's also constantly never enough for me. So I decided to try a late night Lagree class. But right after that, I went to go have some more traditional Lebanese food, because it is so good. I told you, I love to eat out. It's what fills my own cup. Especially trying culture, cuisines, and different kinds of dishes I've never tried before. I ended up walking past this cafe, which had my traditional Lithuanian dessert. That's also how I fill my own cup. Desserts. So I got myself a full thingamajig, which is called Lazy Cake, to finish off the night.",780000

First off, the nightlife is huge here, so the wellness culture isn't as big, but it's here. And the girls here take their fitness so seriously. But unlike Miami and New York, there's not a studio on every single corner, so that makes it a lot more intimate when you come into one. But what I love about this, it's not just a studio for a class. It's a full wellness facility. It has a restaurant and three stories. So you're not just here to do one thing. You can eat, you can vibe, you can chill, you could do muscle recovery. I landed yesterday, and it was my first day teaching sculpt today, so, you know, I had to soak up all my water boy electrolytes. I'm also back to teach. I'm even teaching two classes a day. The demand is really high, and all my classes are currently waitlisted. I love when a studio makes it so accessible for. Just for you to clean up, get changed, shower, wash your hair. Because it's exactly what I needed after teaching. And then also a quick little brunch. This tuna on the sourdough I might be getting every single day here. There's no classes in the studio from 1 to 5, so we host the workshop in the actual studio, which I really love because That's the best way you could possibly learn and get comfortable in an environment. The past months back at home, I have been working and crafting onto this workshop just to create the best roast and truest 10 days for these instructors. Even by day one being finished, we're all slowly starting to open up more and find out our different strengths. It's a very hands on a workshop, with today's focus being warm up, cool downs, breath work, and core activation. We all did some demos and practice all around the room. My goal is to really push these instructors out of their comfort zone. But while I was away working, my dad was exploring the streets of Lebanon without any Wi Fi. He was just popping around the streets. Our phones don't work here. Only when they're connected to Wi Fi. Everyone kept telling me, real raw Lebanese food is amazing. And it definitely is. So if there's a signature dish that I have to try, comment and let me know.",780000

And after my first class, just specifically this video, I fell in love with it. Just the feeling of being in front of a class, teaching, leading, guiding. A different version came out of me, and I found a passion to teach. I've always been the type of person to just take an opportunity and go all in for it. When you see an opportunity, when you feel an opportunity, that's when you have to jump. But if you don't feel ready, you're never, regardless, gonna feel 100% ready. You just have to jump and it'll unfold itself. I heard the saying yesterday, you're gonna feel like you're falling before you fly, but I promise you, once you do, you will soar. So take the risk, say yes, and go through that door. Because you never know what could be on that other side of the door.

And this is exactly what we do in a two hour session. The best way I can explain this machine is you feel your muscles getting hold completely. It's called an EMS machine, and it uses electrical currents to help sculpt, tone, and boost circulation on your body. This is honestly my favorite part because she goes in with her hands and gets so deep into massaging my stomach and my ovaries. Two months ago, I never believed into these lymphatic support massages, but now I go every week, and I've Learned so much about my body and where it holds the most water retention. I also never knew that your body has certain lymphatic point. When you massage them on a weekly, on a daily, it helps detox your body, and all the machines just help stimulate your tissue even further. So, wellness, girly, one on a one. Because I've been in love with learning about my lymphatic system, and this has become a staple in my weekly routine.",780000

So first stop is grabbing a latte before we head to the studio. I just walked into, quite literally my kind of place. You guys, this looks insane. Hahaha. Sorry guys, we're a little bit late. Hi, my name is Crystal. And I'm Jocelyn. So cute. So we're gonna come in here. Some Merritt Morphe eye patches, electrolytes. We have to stay hydrated. We need to stay hydrated in class. It's adorable. And then the most beautiful, beautiful mats. I love this. It is already hot. It is hot. It is. Feel like we're sweating already. Oh, this cute little setup. Here we have the mat X millennia, a balloon that just pulls it out x the amount. I love it here. This is beautiful. Let's get going. Pulls it out at the mat. Out, in, out. Rocking arms. Pulse, you're almost out. Don't give up. Pulse, the exact creator of your future. Everything you do today is incredible. And you guys. Hi. Some time to myself to debrief on everything that happened. Take a deep breath, acknowledge where I am, stay present in the moment, and recognize that life is incredible. And just look at this amazing view. We also got a little latte. No. 2 to day 1 of pull it out. Our post. Pull it out. Yes. Dishes right here. Cheers. Cheers. Out. This is spot. This is spot. Yes. I'm gonna walk again. Looking at the views. I get to like, debrief and look at all the content we took today. And this is my way of doing it. To just slight time to also breathe in deep air and look at what's around me. The. The world and also just look at all the content that we took. Because today was a fun, fun day. I'm just gonna take the time to sit outside for a little bit and thank god for life, because it is incredible and I'm so grateful to have this amazing, beautiful life. Amazing, beautiful life is. Every day is so, so great. Eight thirty PM. But I am ready for bed. Good night, my posing Queens. I am ready for day two.",780000

I don't teach at a physical studio in my area. I'm just worldwide touring every. Every other week around the entire US, around the crazy. Cause I'm leaving basically every single Friday to a new state. And even though I'm traveling the world doing stuff, like, it's crazy cause I'm not. I'm not home now as often. So biggest tip whenever I'm traveling is taking my electrolytes. I take these ones from Water Boy. Every single time I'm traveling, like, every Friday, this is what comes into my water when I'm waiting to board. As much as I absolutely love traveling the world and going to new states all the time and seeing all of you guys, it's a little hard on my body. And I don't want to overwork myself because I'm like, home for three days and I'm back home. So next week I actually get to stay home for a little bit. Um, but I get to stay home and I'm getting, like, my teeth extracted, which is gonna kind of suck. But, um, I'm gonna stay home next week. Besides that, though, post our tour is actually real. And I said that like, two months ago. I was like, guys, post our tour. And It's so literally real. Like, I'm literally traveling every single week. So comment where I should go next, because I've honestly been going all over the place. I already am going to North Carolina. Spoiler alert. Um, in October. So that's a sneak peek. But there's so much more dates lined up, I'm gonna have a whole, like, tour saying of where I'm gonna also be. So I'm gonna see every single one of you.",780000

And you might be thinking, Melania, why do you think you have a parasite? You are so healthy. We could be living the cleanest, healthiest lifestyle ever. But still, 90% of us have a parasite. My symptoms were not going to the restroom regularly at all. Part of the reason because of the extreme sugar cravings I've been having, which has LED to consistent binging multiple times a week, to the point where my stomach physically hurts because of how bloated I am. So I decided to go all in on this parasite purge. But first, I need to prep my body for the parasite purge. It takes a whole month. And this is what the Purge Queen says. Before we even think about killing parasites, we must detox. Open the exit. Meet the body's drainage funnel. If you're not pooping daily, nothing else matters. Open drainage pathways first, then detox. First step. Every morning, I start with the special little mocktail that I make that helps me with my gut health, which is also perfect for your detox and opening up your lymphatic system. Drainage. Then we hop into the supplements. Every morning, I start with seven pills, four different supplements specifically to help open up my body and get my body ready for its detox. It's just been one week, and I already feel well and see the differences in My body 1. Being I'm extremely less bloated and less inflamed in my stomach. 2. My energy levels have been off the roof because that's my mitochondria rebuilding itself. And the biggest bonus, I am using the restroom regularly. Now this is just week one of the prep. I can't wait to see how my body feels like during the actual purge. So stay tuned because I'm gonna be updating you guys weekly.",780000

Then this is how we make the sweet potato cupcakes even sweeter. We add two cups of dates. Yeah, two cups of dates, which are incredible and I could honestly eat by the handful. Now, we add four eggs. Then we have one and a/2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, and we have 2/3 cup of coconut oil, two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Now, no, you do you have to say it with me. Now we blend, blend till smooth, scrape all the way through the sides, and then blend it again so we could get all the dates in there. Now we're onto the dry ingredients. See, what do we have? 3 cups of whole wheat flour. 3 cups of whole wheat flour, two teaspoons of baking soda, two teaspoons of baking powder. For some flavour, we have some cinnamon. Susan says it's all the way. We gotta do a lot of cinnamon, because this is how you get that fall flavor. And we also have nutmeg. Nutmeg for some extra fall flavor. Just a little bit, though, because it's strong. A pinch of salt. The wet ingredients to the dry, all in one bowl, so it's Like, no multiple bowls. It's an easy, easy recipe. Cheers. Cheers. A little bit of date. That's perfect. Now we scoop every single muffin into its own little pocket. How are you cooking these? For 12 to 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Boom! They're ready for the oven. They're in there, they're in there. How you make those amazing famous sweet potato muffin. What's ready to make our date caramel. So we soak these dates in water and we pour out the water, all of the dates, to a blender, because we're gonna mix everything up again. Almond milk is optional. If you want, you could just be using the date water. The date water, but to make it a little bit more creamier, a little bit more nut flavour, I'm gonna use some almond milk. Pinch of salt.

I am so much more than my body. Since we've been on the topic crushing of weight gain, let's talk about it even more. So many of us are constantly living, breathing, doing every single action, every single meal, exercise, to align with this smallest, leanest physique that we envision ourselves and have made it like the status and like, that is our ideal physique that we have to look like in order to be happy, to be confident. Why have we made every single action in our life revolving around our physique? God did not put us on this planet. And I keep telling myself, god did not put me on this planet to think and stress about the size of my stomach or my. How my physique looks like or just skipping out on meals and overexercising and doing so many different things. I was not put on this planet to do that. I was put on this planet to love, joy and create a family and have an amazing time and be who I'm meant to be. Not stress about what my physique looks like, tracking food and just looking good in a bathing suit. I am how I talked about gaining weight and putting on more weight and seeing my physique that I've been so used to being super lean and shredded, and I've been, like, clinked. So clinked. On to that. Because I've just idolize this physique in my head that that's what I have to look like. That's what I always have to look up to. When that's not true. Because we are so much more than our bodies, it worry we don't become memorable by our physiques, but by emotional connection. When you meet someone, that's the first thing you don't. You don't just connect with them because of their body. You connect because of the conversation, how genuine, how grounded they are, their energy, their connection, their vibes. That's what you remember about a person, not their physique. Life is so much more than what just our bodies look like. Whether that's you with 10 more pounds. Ten more. Like 10 more pounds of whatever. Whatever. Like, I've seen myself gaining weight. Yes, I will say it is hard. It is hard because I've been in, like, this idealized physique in my head of having a super lean physique. But I constantly remind myself, I was not put on this planet to stress about my body. I am so much more than my body. Life is so much more than about my body. It's about enjoying, having great times, like, enjoying eating whatever I want without even having to overthink about it. Just to have a great time with life. Because that's what I want to remember. Like, when you are on your deathbed, are you gonna be remembering, like, what you stressing about your Body and, like, skipping on certain things and like, being so life revolving around your physique. Are you gonna think about the energy, in the connections, in the relationships that you made? Ask yourself that question.",780000

And this weekend, I was at Boston, specifically Gardner, which I Learned then is in Boston. Girls from all over the place, two hours, three hours, even four hours away, drove over to the Pulse Out event. These girls asked for the hardest workout of their lives, and I gave them exactly that. This isn't just Mat Pilates. My signature sculpt class incorporating strength training and mat Pilates plus a heated room and all time under tension. Might sound easy, but I promise you, it's not. I've always wanted to have, like, a cute little yogurt bar set up at one of my events, and this time we did. You got to choose your toppings. A bunch of granola, a bunch of berries, then you come over to the drink station, which was my favourite. All I want after a class is an iced. So we had a local coffee shop set up some lattes for every girl, then one of my favourite clean, refreshing collagen drinks. That's not all. After class, you have the option to go into the cold plunge, which I honestly wish I could do after every single class. It makes me feel like I could redo the class all over again. So we knocked off Boston. Up next, California.",780000

She did everything. Like a full little container of like, coconut, um, chia pudding, which she made herself with mangoes. Delicious. I finished that all, a full thing of zucchini muffins. My favorite. With nuts, without nuts. And she knows that I love zucchinis. Made it herself. She did everything herself. Like it does, like, everything. Whipped shea butter on her own, like rose. Rosemary oil for My hair, treat your oil, for my face, for my skin. Just everything. A full goody bag of little things. And she told me, you always spoil everyone, and you give everybody goodies, but you don't get a goody bag. And she's like, so I got you one. This is why I do what I do, Alex. I love you, and I love every single one of you that showed up, because being able to connect and talk to every single one of you after class is so heartwarming to hear. Where you guys come from, what you guys do, like, with the differences, the inspiration that I made, the workouts that we do together, like, everything. This is why I do what I do. It makes me so happy, because I literally, vividly remember me being five months ago and saying, I am gonna travel the world and just train with everyone around the world, and here I am doing just that. Your thoughts come to your reality. Believe it, say it, do it, and it will happen. I love you, Queen, so much, because you guys, you guys are my inspiration.

So we're gonna talk about it. There's a couple reasons I wanna gain weight. One of them is a big thing as for health reasons. Two, I kind of do wanna see myself. It's a little bit more body fat in certain areas and put on a little bit more muscle. Body fat, in some ways the main factor we're gonna talk about right now, because I feel like so many people are scared of weight gain because we've idolized a lean physique and idolized this lean tone version of ourselves. More than ever right now, I am seeing every single girl idolize the small, smallest version of themselves, the leanest versions of themselves, the smallest waist, all of this and just living, breathing for that physique, forgetting about, how could it be affecting, like, your future self, your future family, your, your future husband, so many other factors in your life, your health, your hormones, everything. And it's only because we've idolized this physique to. To try to maintain, only living, only eating the way, only moving the way that we are, just to have this physique, not because we enjoy it. Yeah, you could be enjoying it, but you're really doing it deep down because of your physique. Like, you're not doing anything else. It's only like every single action you're doing in your life is. Is leading up to Your physique. In our heads as girls, we've. We've, like, locked into this thing of that we have to look the certain way to be able to be happy, to be confident, to do anything, and it could be affecting our future lives. Really had to smack my face into reality and say, Milani, I care about my future self. I care about my future family, my future husband, my future everything. And I want to be the healthiest version of myself, because to be all. To be complete reality. Like doing all the healthy dieting, healthy eating, like exercise, all the stuff, like. And if your. If your health is not in check, you're not living a healthy lifestyle. So many people are overusing the term healthy when it's not really healthy. So right now, I really just accepted how I said weight gain and, like, just life. I think my. My life is so much more than just my physique, so much more than just my ABS, my stomach and everything. And I just. I wanna enjoy my life with myself, and it's not just about my body. So I'm accepting my weight gain and I'm loving it. And I hope every girl does too, and we stop idolizing this physique and just go living for our bodies. Because life is so much more than just our bodies. And I just want to get that message across, because it is. So many girls need to hear this, especially Right now, I'm seeing so many girls try to eat as less as possible and try to idolize and keep this small, skinny, lean physique when that's not what life is about. It's hard, I'm not gonna lie. But I'm trying to accept this new, new stage, new version, and the wakening of myself, and. And I'm gonna love it.",780000

So that means I started prepping when I was 17. And even though I'm not in the bodybuilding lifestyle anymore, I Learned so much from, and it set me to where I am today. Help me realize what I don't want to do and what I do want to do with my life. Right after my bodybuilding show, I started sharing so much more of my true self. My personality really just came out, and I started speaking to the camera a lot more. I've always loved being on camera, instructing, leading. And that comes from my background of theater. So then I kind of put everything together. Leading, workouts, fitness, and being on camera. This is your reminder that you are the package. And it takes being in the right environment to really find and build your true self. Because one year ago today, when I was a bodybuilder, I did not have this kind of shine and personality that I do today. Many would even say I was the quite opposite.",780000

But my car almost got stuck in a garage. Before we get into that, we gotta pick up Justin Joseph. It is bright and early in the morning. 7:00am. Just came in with the full box of zucchini cake and sweet potato muffins. Justin Joseph are Pilates studio owners, but not Matt Pilates. So we thought, why not switch it up and take a mat class today? Since Jess isn't used to heated workouts, I made her take some electrolytes with me. These water wear ones are the ones I carry with me everywhere I go. You know the kind of instructor I am, and I love a super intense class. This was a very, I would say beginner to map, which is completely fine because her cueing and tone was incredible, which uplifted the class. It's not just about the workout, but how you speak to your class. We call these our little rolling balls, which is kind of the best part of class. And yes, it's a classical Pilates move, so it's really good for you. And after this peacock, this is where the parking struggles begin. Long story short, we went in a garage where my car did not fit and I couldn't go anywhere. But we all agreed to just leave the problem and figure it out later. Just basically booked her flight to come to this farmers market. That's how bad she wanted to come here. And That's how good it is. Everything here is all organic, all vegan. We had some vegan sushi rolls, and then also, like, 300 samples. And that's the face of me never saying no to a dessert. The sign said, eat better, feel better, but I ate six chocolate chip cookie. But it's okay, you know, we had some balance. I had to get some two hard boiled eggs in. Joseph has also been third Wheeling this whole time. It's time to figure out how to get my car out of this garage, because the only way out that I would fit it's through the front entrance. So we had to go find someone, call someone to go get that front gate open so I can leave. But obviously, we did it. Dad, if you're watching this, it's okay. Nothing happened to the car. So I call this a successful day. Pilates, matcha, coffee, and my car is safe and sound.",780000

So I'm taking them around the best places in Florida. Second matcha of the day was from Six Coffee Bar, and it was the Banana Matcha. Just by watching this video, you'll be able to tell our kind of fun is going to cafes, healthy places, coffee, matcha, and Pilates. And I'm not complaining, because this is what I do every, every single day. So we kicked off lunch at Living Green until the biggest Hurricane hit us. And they're from New York, so they're not used to the constant in and out, bipolar weather in Florida. We stopped to get some lactate for Jess because she's about to have some dairy this weekend. We made it a goal to find the best matcha and coffee place in South Florida this weekend. First pull body stop of the weekend was remix with my girl Emmy. Obviously we were in Boca, but I was still ripping out the Springs, Pilates, grip socks, guys. I have so many grip socks, it's unreal. Jess and Joseph know I'm a little bit crazy when it comes to classes, and I love to do a lot, as in, some days there's two back to back classes. Even when we were in Long Island, they made us actual super hard Routine just for me. So they're ready to go through a lot of classes. I mentally prepared them because tomorrow we have two classes in Miami. You'll be surprised thinking that they're Pilates studio owners and that they take class every single day, but they actually told me this is one of the first classes they've taken in months, and that's just because how busy their studio is. So there's this bakery in Long Island, which is my favorite. Last month, just ship give me the cookies for my birthday, and then they brought them again for me, and I already finished, too. But what they were most excited for was to go to Fit Food. They've been watching all of my post here, eating my signature dishes, my chocolate chips, zucchini bread. So this is the only place they wanted to go to for dinner. And let me tell you, Jess and Joseph, we're shocked, as in, we already made plans to go again tomorrow. Also, I got Jess to be in her influencer era, so she's been vlogging the weekend, and we sampled every single dessert here, and they had to try. It was their first time here. Jess said that if they lived here, they would be here every day, and I basically am, too. So this was day one of our Pilates weekend kick off, and we're ready for day two tomorrow.",780000

As the cupcakes bake, we have to make the date caramel. Soak these in warm water to make them nice and soft for when we blend them to make the caramel. We add everything to a blender. Splash of vanilla, some almond milk to thin out the texture, a dash of salt. Now we're gonna frost the cupcakes with our Date caramel. That is how you make cupcakes out of sweet potatoes.",780000

Hey, it's Melania. You're screaming. Instructor and I've been known for my intense teaching style and my quads also maintaining that lean toned physique. And that's because of my training and lifestyle change, because of how much I move sweat and my eating patterns, I've been able to maintain a shredded physique, literally freakishly shredded naturally without even trying. And yeah it is super cool. But it has come to a point where I'm starting to think even deeper into my future self and about my health. You guys have seen what I eat in a day and it looks super clean majority of the time. I love Whole Foods, I love protein and I love eating clean foods. But you don't see the nights where I am Downing multiple desserts and maybe up to even 5,000 calories. And with all honesty lately it has been like that the past two months and obviously I'm gaining weight and it is truly very hard. One direction trying to eat more more and gain weight for my health reasons and the next having the biggest battle in my head seeing myself gain weight cause I was so used to being so lean and shredded and I idolise that physique. Seeing myself gain weight now, gain body fat, hold water retention is hard. But I'm thinking about my future self, my future Melania and my health comes First. And I am more than just my body. It is my energy that attracts. So this is me accepting that I am gaining weight, and I am just trying my best to love it and embrace it.",780000

But if it's you, here's an easy and effective routine you can do right on the treadmill. Before your next run, your body needs a proper warm up to increase your core temperature, making your muscles more elastic and oxygenated before any physical activity. Activating and taking the muscles that help stabilize your hips, knees, and ankles through its full range of motion will help you run smoother and lighter, but save you from unwanted injuries. This routine helps open up the hips, fire up your glutes, the nervous system, and prime your joints. So when you finally hit start, your body is already in performance mode. So whether you decide to have a short run with a lift or just focus on running, give it a try and let me know how you feel.",371000

Running isn't just physical. It's a mirror. And in the beginning? It humbles you. Your body resists, your mind negotiates, and everything in you wants to quit. Why? Because the comfort zone is seductive — it convinces you that change is too hard, that growth is too far, that you're not made for it. Staying consistent is the basis of the success behind every journey. The struggle becomes strength. The pain becomes purpose. The steps that once felt impossible start to feel like home. And that's where the magic happens...when discomfort becomes your new normal and movement becomes your medicine. I will be honest if I didn't have to negotiate with myself a thousand times before I relinquished to the idea that if I want to run a marathon, I'm going to temporarily lose the identity l've had for so many years. I like being strong, BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRONG. And so many people don't even get to experience the other side of why running is so freeing. So here we go, stay resilient. You are your biggest priority! Give it time. Trust the process.

If you've ever struggled to stay consistent with your workouts, the issue isn't willpower. It's how your brain is wired to form habits. Habits are built through a loop: cue, routine, reward.When you repeat a behavior, your brain releases dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that reinforces the action and encourages you to do it again. Over time, that behavior shifts from conscious effort to automatic pattern. This happens in the basal ganglia, the part of your brain responsible for habit formation and motor control. The more consistent you are, the less effort it takes to show up. YOUR HOMEWORK: 1. ﻿﻿﻿Pair your workout with a daily cue (like morning coffee or finishing work). 2. ﻿﻿﻿Set up your environment to make movement the easy choice. 3. ﻿﻿﻿Lower the barrier by committing to just five minutes. 4. ﻿﻿﻿And don't skip the reward, celebrate completion, because positive emotion strengthens the neural connection. This is how real behavior change happens.  Not overnight, but through intentional repetition that rewires your brain to crave the thing that once felt hard. Consistency creates identity. Identity sustains action. You become what you repeatedly do. #childofgod #hijadecristo #motivation #mondaymotivation #inspiration #realtalk #consistency ",8125,759,38,68,massy.arias,6787832513445987333,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias,MS4wLjABAAAAuyfg3MZP7jfU3PCrM-4B5r5AnEOXyO_3Uq_DzOmC-EC2-Rbi90P9-OKFwbbP9ruH,Massy.Arias,2025-07-14,1752511889,96,#childofgod #hijadecristo #motivation #mondaymotivation #inspiration #realtalk #consistency,original sound,,720,1276,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias/video/7526981142545714463,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/oY13ZAiZ6RMU41BAiV5HcNaURBVAuIqvRIEUj~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=9CKMCRa0RYYoG68Z6TPeJx%2Bwkbw%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"If you keep falling off your workouts, it's not because you're lazy, it's because you're missing this part of the process. So let's talk about building the habit of working out and what science says is not about motivation. Every habit follows a single loop, cue, routine and reward. So your brain sees a trigger and follows it with a behavior like training and locks it in with a reward. That post workout high that you feel, that's dopamine. That's your brain saying, let's do that again. And this happens in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. It's where repeated movement becomes automatic. That's why workouts get easier to start once you have made them part of your identity. So here's what actually works. I want you to take notes, stack your workout to an existing habit. For example, after you make your morning coffee, change into your workout clothes, then use visual cues. You're gonna lay your workout clothes the night before, put your shoes by the door and let your environment remind you of who you are becoming. Lower the barrier, commit to just five minutes. Once you actually start moving, momentum is going to take over and you have to celebrate the wins. Even if the workout was short, what you think you become, the emotion you attach to the behavior helps your brain lock it in faster. And here's the most important shift. Stop trying to be perfect and start being consistent because Repetition plus emotion equals retention. And that's how habits stick. You're not just working out, you're casting votes for the kind of person you want to be. Let's get it, team. You got this.",371000

Judging by the creatine I pulled before this workout, you guessed it. It's your lower body strength. Women with strong legs don't just move better, they age better. Studies show that lower body strength is directly linked to greater mobility, better heart health, and even reduced risk of death from all causes. A huge meta analysis of nearly 1.9 million people found that stronger lower bodies are linked to 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Even after adjusting age, sex, and fitness level, women who strength train regularly show longer telomeres, markers of a younger biological age. You're not just getting stronger, you're literally slowing the clock. This is why lifting heavy on leg day is my favorite. It's not just about aesthetics. It's about vitality, hormones, strength, and your future self. So don't be afraid to pick up those heavy dumbbells. Your strongest years are built one rep at a time.",371000

As a mother, a woman, and an entrepreneur, I know how hard it is to prioritize ourselves, our, health, our children, our hormones, our energy, and our peace. This company was born out of those struggles, and now it's evolving to meet you exactly where you are. When I founded Tru, I was a girly who wanted to consume clean supplements to support my health and fitness goals in an industry that was so far fetched. It was out of experiencing complications with products and supplements that still stand today in the market, that I decided to make my own. 10 years later we keep raising the bar and competing in a market where small businesses struggle thanks to you. To every woman who's trusted me, followed me, supported my vision — THANK YOU. This isn't just a rebrand... it's a REVOLUTION. And I'm taking you with me. We are rebranding, growing the team, and I cannot wait to continue to evolve it. It's been a lot of hard work but here I am, still standing and excited to see the vision align.

I get the Daisy brand). * ﻿﻿1 cup Cilantro (this will depend on your preference, but don't be shy). * ﻿﻿2 limes. * ﻿﻿One red and ripe tomato. * ﻿﻿2 garlic cloves * ﻿﻿salt and pepper to taste. Why I Like this recipe: Cilantro is rich in antioxidants, supports digestion, and cleans the blood from heavy metals. Garlic boosts the immune system while helps with inflammation. Tomatoes are rich in licopene and vitamin C for our skin. Cottage cheese adds protein and calcium. Like juice supports liver detox and gives it a refreshing kick.

When you move with power, you activate the systems that protect your brain, create longevity, and build emotional resilience. To combat anxiety and depression, movement sharpens focus.

Here's why: Soreness and low motivation the day or a couple of days after a tough workout is normal. While it's counterintuitive to think of training or moving, it doesn't mean you should skip movement entirely. In fact, it's movement that often gets you out of the funk. I always emphasize that movement creates movement. When you start with just 5-10 minutes of low-intensity Zone 2 cardio (like walking, cycling, or light elliptical), or even a simple dynamic warm-up (think hip openers, bodyweight squats, shoulder circles like in this video), you're doing more than just loosening up your body. You're activating your brain and nervous system too. Here's what's happening: - Your brain releases endorphins: feel-good chemicals that relieve pain and elevate mood. - You stimulate dopamine: a neurotransmitter tied to motivation and reward. - Blood flow increases to your muscles and prefrontal cortex, helping you feel more alert, focused, and ready to train. - Your parasympathetic nervous system starts to calm inflammation and muscle tension as your body adapts. The first few minutes might feel stiff or slow, but stay with it. Once you warm up, the resistance fades. You're not being lazy, you're just HUMAN! . Start small, let momentum take over and watch how you will feel amazing. PS: I even did pull ups today and had the greatest workout which means tomorrow I'll hop back on and do some zone two cardio and some major stretching. My warm up: 1x8 reps - Neck circles: esch side - Arm circles - Trunk rotations - Hip circles each side - Shin box - Downdog to plank  SHARE THIS WITH A FRIEND, AND LET'S KEEP MOVING. #childofgod #hijadecristo #sculptprogram #strengthtraining #motivation #legday #mobility #stretching #fitnessmotivation #sore #inspiration #athomeworkout ",42400,3337,30,77,massy.arias,6787832513445987333,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias,MS4wLjABAAAAuyfg3MZP7jfU3PCrM-4B5r5AnEOXyO_3Uq_DzOmC-EC2-Rbi90P9-OKFwbbP9ruH,Massy.Arias,2025-05-22,1747936040,40,#childofgod #hijadecristo #sculptprogram #strengthtraining #motivation #legday #mobility #stretching #fitnessmotivation #sore #inspiration #athomeworkout,original sound,,720,1280,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias/video/7507328077458935070,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/osIjvQWIDCsG3AjemHIAMLIIZYGMwXBoeeJJyq~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=veQykW2FE2XldJKop0cLlVIrKqQ%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"Tribe, have you ever been so sore that everything in you wanted to skip your next workout? If that's you, keep watching. Now, let's break down some science for you. If you want to recover and get motivated for that next workout, you must move. Just five to 10 minutes of light Zone 2 cardio will increase circulation, reduce muscle stiffness, and deliver oxygen and nutrients to sore muscles. Your brain releases endorphins, your natural painkillers, and dopamine, which boosts motivation. You're also activating your prefrontal cortex, improving your focus and mood.

Let's get into a solid warm-up routine that'll have your body saying thank you every step of the way. Whether you're jogging your first mile or you're just a beginner. We're starting with foam rolling - to warm up our muscles, increase elasticity in our muscles, improve range of motion, and increase blood flow to prep our muscles pre run. ⚫️Glutes — tight glutes = unhappy hips. Loosen them up so they can fire properly. ⚫️Hamstrings — lengthen those strings so you don't pull one mid-run. ⚫️Calves — we want bounce, not bricks. Roll 'em smooth. ⚫️Quads — especially if you sit a lot, these get tight and tug on your knees. Now let's activate and move: ⚫️Tibialis raises - this is your shin muscle. Think strong knees and ankles — these help prevent shin splints and help take the load off the knees. ⚫️Leg swings - front to back, side to side. Open those hips, get that range going. ⚫️Hamstring scoops - stretch with control. Scoop low, feel the stretch, keep it fluid. ⚫️Single leg calf raises — this builds strength and balance right where you push off in every stride. Warm muscles = powerful performance + fewer injuries. So give your body this moment before the miles.

Last month I decided to take on the hardest thing I could ever do. Little did I know, l'd have Indi interested in joining me. I didn't have to force it. All I did was model for her. I never saw my mother take care of herself in this way. I never saw her exercise to manage stress, her hormones, her overall well being-| learned how to take care of myself in a different way and today I can teach my mother how to regain her own strength. Studies show that mothers serve as primary role models for their children, especially in early childhood. Children learn what is considered socially, ethically, and morally right and wrong by watching their mothers' behavior. We often say things like : I'd die for my children, but would you live for them? This is the beginning of something amazing and I wanted to share it with you all today. To all of you my queens whether you are mothers or not, taking care of ourselves physically is how we can show our little ones how to be resilient and keep themselves healthy physically and mentally.

TAG SOMEONE WHO NEEDS THIS: Pain is not the enemy-it's the body's built-in intelligence speaking to you. We live in a time where there's a pill for everything— instant relief, quick fixes, numb the discomfort. But if we never allow ourselves to feel, how do we ever evolve? We've been conditioned to see pain as something to avoid, to silence, to numb. But in reality, pain is a powerful protective mechanism. It's your body's way of saying: ""Pay attention."" Pain signals are designed to help you adapt and overcome. When you touch something hot, your nerves fire off a warning, making you pull away before real damage is done. When you push too hard in training, soreness tells you where to recover and rebuild. When you experience emotional pain, it forces you to reflect, adjust, and move differently. But what happens when we constantly mask pain instead of addressing it? We weaken our ability to adapt. We suppress the lesson. We disconnect from our natural ability to heal. Instead of running from pain, lean in and listen. Your body is always guiding you toward a solution-whether it's movement, nourishment, rest, or a mindset shift. True strength isn't found in avoidance; it's built in the moments when you choose to face it, feel it, and evolve through it. Your pain is not your weakness. It's your wisdom. #childofgod #hijadecristo #BuiltToAdapt #motivation #inspiration #workoutmotivation #fitnessmotivation ",7021,289,16,16,massy.arias,6787832513445987333,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias,MS4wLjABAAAAuyfg3MZP7jfU3PCrM-4B5r5AnEOXyO_3Uq_DzOmC-EC2-Rbi90P9-OKFwbbP9ruH,Massy.Arias,2025-03-11,1741714149,30,#childofgod #hijadecristo #BuiltToAdapt #motivation #inspiration #workoutmotivation #fitnessmotivation,original sound,,720,1280,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@massy.arias/video/7480605101233720622,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast5-p-0068-tx/oAuQRnkC0rKEEcNSDAI2q4KfvaagDFIDAeSB0H~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=Ri7Ge6JA5WYREjfCkJjhHbjWfBU%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"Pain is temporary.

You don't have to strive to be a track star or an Olympic athlete, but maintaining these qualities throughout your life to the best of your abilities is a must. Sprinting and jumping are key to improving bone density, a powerful core, and a resilient and strong pelvic floor. Every time your foot strikes the ground in a sprint, or you land from a jump, your pelvic floor engages to absorb impact and stabilize your core. These movements train your body to react, strengthen, and state resilient just like any other muscle. Over time, skipping explosive movements lead to weakness, instability, and even. But we can change that. Sprinting, jumping, and running build strength, power, and control where it matters most. So don't stop moving.",371000

Here's a breakdown of how to get the most from them. Forearm plank - push away from floor with your forearms and tuck the hips under at the same time. This activates the core muscles and the lats. Keep your entire lower body engaged with knees extended. Modified side plank - similar cues as before but also lift your hips away from the floor to activate the obliques. Feet can be stacked or top foot in front like I'm showing here. Keep neck elongated. Reverse plank - lift those hips by driving the heels into the floor, activating your glutes and hamstrings. Push away from the foam roller to avoid any excess pressure on the wrists. Think of creating a long straight line from the top of your head to your feet. Try these tips and let me know how you feel afterwards! It's all about how you train, not just going through the motions. Use that mind muscle connection to feel the difference.

For that matter it is my responsibility you keep challenging yourself and keep it super fun. Why Bulgarians: HELLO GLUTES! From correcting imbalances, to glute development, core engagement, athletic performance, spinal health, and even hip mobility, this exercise for me will always be QUEEN! The zertcher: Allows for a more vertical load focusing more on anterior chain. Loads the quads, core and upper spine. This is one of my favorite variations. The landmine variation:  allows you to load moderate weight. Challenges your core stabilizers amongst all muscles of the lower extremities. The front barbell variation:  just like the zertcher loads more of the quads, core, and upper back muscles amongst all muscles of the lower extremities. The back barbell variation:  allows for heavy loads that target your glutes and lower extremities. This variation I find to be one where I can really load heavy. Let me know which ones you have tried or will try.

Unless the parental figure creates a behavioral pattern of fear around that child, he or she is fearless and unstoppable. Where does the fear come into play? Interestingly enough, when we stop playing and moving like we used to. Then what happens when we get older in this modern world?—WE STOP MOVING. We get in our chairs to learn, in our cars to drive, our social events to entertain and most of us become parents with big responsibilities. Then, the pattern changes to working out and moving because you have to in order to lose weight. Exercise becomes a chore instead of a daily practice, our lives become limited to the resources we have to find movement with anything and everywhere. The limitations you feel today are often created by a lack of movement in those patterns. Often you feed into that reality because it sounds easier to deal and adapt to the thought of getting older and accepting the pain you're in instead of working towards reversing it all (more o often than not this is doable, preventable, and sustainable). I wanted to make this post to give you not only a little fun thing to do and practice when you're bored and want to try to master something new, but to open your mind that it will be hard to start to move again, but the body will adapt in the same way that it adapted to you not doing SO.

Inhale as your belly drops, exhale as you round the shoulders and tuck the hips under.  - Happy baby: you may have to find a few towels or straps if you are very tight and can't use your hands to get into the position.

The Forester made it super easy to load up our tree with no stress at all. After we found the perfect one, we carefully strapped it on top, and it stayed secure and safe the whole way home. And honestly, having that peace of mind made the whole experience so much more enjoyable. It’s days like these that remind me how lucky I am to have a car that supports me through the chaos and lets me enjoy the special moments with my daughter.

But first, let me take you through my busy day. I jumped in my Subaru Forester, which I've been relying on on these hectic days. I had a video shoot for some exciting stuff coming up, and then headed to do some Christmas shopping for Indy before I picked her up from school. We picked up the Christmas tree and, of course, had a blast doing it. And look, I get it. As parents, the holidays can feel overwhelming with everything that needs to get done. But with the Subaru as my right hand woman, on days like these, I can relax and remind myself to soak in this moment with my daughter, which is what truly matters. Christmas magic is alive and well in this house, that's for sure. And what a great year this has been with Subaru. As you can see, our elf definitely has a mind of his own. Happy holidays, everyone.",371000

Just wrapped up an unforgettable camping adventure with Indi. With the reliable 2025 Subaru Forester as our trusty sidekick, we ventured into nature as this is one of the ways I connect with myself and if there is something l'd like to teach her it's how to be in touch with herself and use nature to feel grounded and recharge in the future. We spent our time hiking through lush trails, scavenging for crystals, watching the sun set and rise, and best of all, really connecting. We embraced the beauty of nature, and it was amazing how these moments can deepen our connection, every shared glance reminded me just how strong our bond is. The Subaru has been steadfast and reliable on these trips and we have come to trust and love our car and the countless shared adventures it's been with us on. Our next trip will be our longest for the holidays and I hope I can bring magic to end the year as a family. Thank you, Subaru, for being the trusted partner that helps us create these cherished memories! Who would you want to take glamping?

From the moment we hit the sand, it's all about laughter, sandcastles, and those precious, carefree moments that make our hearts full.  These moments are a testament to the incredible people in my life-especially my little one, who brings boundless energy and joy into every day.

From smooth, worry-free drives to the flexibility we need for spontaneous beach trips, the Forester is built to handle it all-just like the people I rely on.

Promise me you'll tell me how you feel when you try it. Tag a friend and save this for later. This is very simple and you may start more away from the wall than I am or just do it against your couch. The sequence is simple: hold the first two stretches for 30s each side, and do 10 rotations on the last one. That simple. Notes: make sure you squeeze the glute of the leg that's on the wall for the couch stretch and tuck hips under when you do the first two exercises. Keep arms as straight as possible for the rotations. Push away from the floor of the arm that is supporting you. First few rounds will be more intense but in a matter of a few days you will start to losen up and feel the incredible benefits.

It's definitely a more upcoming, you know, area arena. And going into entertainment law is not the easiest because you have to have either really good connections or a really good network. I went to the entertainment easel program at Miami Law and I graduated cum laude. But I always feel like the one job that I am best suited for is working with celebrities. I feel like I am meant to work in Hollywood and my dream job would be working as an attorney for either, you know, a big company, a beauty company, a beauty brand and a clothing brand, something like that. But I also see myself working like directly with a celebrity and their brand because I just feel like I know so much about that sphere. So if anyone knows where I can find out those kind of roles, I would love some insight. And I just don't wanna settle for a job that I don't love. Everyone's always like, don't settle for insurance defense. But at the same time, you know, I'm first gen. I also am financially independent. I know these roles are out there. So I feel like I just have such a community on TikTok that maybe someone could direct me in the right direction.",307700

You wanna track more followers and you wanna, you know, build an audience. However, a lot of influencers and gym influencers won't tell you that the thing that gets the more views is doing close UPS on assets that you know are inappropriate, you know, doing specific movements and zooming the camera in so that it gets more views. Doing inappropriate things you probably wouldn't post regularly unless you had followers. And the more followers you get, the more confidence you have to post that type of content. So naturally, as I started gaining more views and having more of an audience, I realized I was attracting the wrong audience and I wanted to change that. I'm also going into a field that's very professional. I just took the bar exam. I want to become an attorney and I'm very well close to that. So I took down a lot of my videos. I, you know, removed so many things. And with that, that also meant that I was losing views because I was no longer posting that inappropriate content that was getting me so many views. I want my page to be about motivation, discipline, grit, getting to where you wanna be because I worked hard to get the body that I have, but also to get to where I Am today from going from Hamilton Ontario to Miami, Florida. It's a big shift. Now what that means that a lot of brands will no longer support you because you don't have those views. A lot of right brands won't want to work with you because you don't have those views and I realized that I was okay with that. However, there was one brand that always always committed to continue working with me despite my view count going down because I no longer post those types of videos and that was YSL YSL, I love you because you continue to send me PR even though I don't post specific content that used to get the views it it it would and um, yeah, they sent me this how adorable they sent me the new Black Opium perfume they sent me their new blush which just look at how freaking cute this packaging is and they sent me a new lip gloss and mind you, they could they've continued sending me things like how adorable it's literally red themed.

Mind you the reason I ask is because we end up starting later every time cause we're doing they want to start later Fingerprinting. They want to see it later. We're doing something, they're explaining something, someone's asking questions. So I like to know how much time because guys, if you Mark anything on that exam sheet, you type one letter past the time, they will disqualify your whole exam. Like it's not a joke. So I'm in the middle of the exam and I call over the Proctor and I say, how much time do I have left? Like what time are we ending at? She goes, we're ending at 12:31. I go through, what I like to do is I go through my exam and then I star ones that I was really hesitant on and I go back and I read it again and I try to like feel good about the answer that I chose. So I go through the whole, I'm on the last question. I'm on the last question. I bubble it in. She calls time. The proctors call time. I look up, what time is it? It's 12:01. So I look at the Proctor that told me I had until 12:31 and I go, you said 12:31? And she said, my bad, that was a mistake. It was actually 12:01. That was a mistake. That that was a mistake. It was a mistake. Do you know if I wrote on my exam past the time, my whole exam would have been disqualified. I would have had to retake the bar. It is crazy to me that A Proctor can just make a mistake about timing and what time you end at just just because just because they made a mistake like that would have been my whole exam my whole exam part 2 it's PM session. I'm in the middle of my exam. I'm like looking at the time consistently like I'm actually marking down I divide it by hour to see to make sure that I hit a certain amount of questions in the hour time slot. I'm like that particular guys I call over one of the prosecutors I go, just to be just just to be clear we're ending at this time right? Because I know we started like 10 15 minutes later. You want to know what the prosecutor says to me? He goes, you end at I just remember him saying you end at blank 45 + 19 minutes. I was like, so what time is that? And he's like, I don't know I'm not good at math. I'm in the middle of the bar exam the bar exam and you're gonna sit here and say blah blah blah 45 + 19 minutes like you be so for real be so for real. These these proctors actually had me going insane. I don't know if anyone else had this experience. It was actually nuts.",307700

Like I will just cut you off, never talk to you again and we could be friends for 500 years. I, I really don't care. Like if you don't wanna take accountability.

The question i get asked every time is “how do you have time and still get good grades” and the truth is i have three priorities in my life. My first is school, second is the gym and third is my family/relationships. I will skip social gatherings if I have a packed day of school so that i can spend the time i have working out. There will always be social gatherings! But if I don’t workout, my mental health will diminish and i cant be my best self for my friends and family. The gym is my “me time” and without it i would go insane especially with the chaotic schedule we have in law. If we dont start these habits now, we will fail exponentially in practice.

Sorry. I've spent 14 years building my body and I've worked with over 1,000 clients at this point, both in person and online. And the first sign that somebody isn't going to make it in the long run is not having a clear why. If you don't have a strong why, you will not have the grit to endure the inevitable discomfort that comes along with shifting lifestyle habits, hitting the workouts you don't wanna hit, and resisting the impulses and old patterns that have kept you stuck. Which leads me to my second sign, and that's being hyper fixated on quick results. Now, wanting to optimize your results is not a bad thing. But if somebody's number one concern is getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible, usually these are the people who are going extreme or not at all, so nothing sticks. Still in the mindset that fitness is temporary instead of a lifestyle that they live. And finally, the surest sign that somebody will never achieve their dream physique is they think they know everything. These are the people who are unwilling to learn or adjust their approach. They have set the limit on their potential because they think they have it all figured out. And if you did, by the way, you'd probably be well on your way to achieving your dream physique, or you'd already have it.",120000

Most people start leg day with a squat. And that's great, especially if you're newer to lifting or it's already working well for you. But here's the problem. Squats don't directly target the rectus femoris, that mid quad muscle, the way a leg extension does. On top of that, squats create a ton of fatigue that carries over into the rest of your workout. That's why I recommend flipping the order. Start with leg extensions before your squat movement. Since they're an isolation exercise, you'll get better quad recruitment right out of the gate with far less fatigue. Going single leg can be even better and is especially useful once you're maxing out the machine. If overall leg development is your priority, keep squats first. But if quad growth has been lagging, start your next leg day with leg extensions and see the difference for yourself.",120000

Here's why I structure it this way I start with a chest supported row to target the upper back and get pulling volume in first. Then an incline machine press since upper chest is a priority for me and I noticed less of a strength drop here compared to starting with flat. Next is a single arm lat pull down to hit the lats directly and even out strength. Side side back to chest with a flat press for overall pec development. Then lateral raises since my side delts haven't been hit effectively up to this point. And finally arms. A single arm row pushdown for triceps and a barbell curl for biceps. Both great all around movements. Seven movements under an hour. Focus on efficiency and balance across the upper body.,120000

If that’s the case, you’re likely missing out on gains because the best growth stimulus happens when you’re consistently training in that 0–2 RIR range. That doesn’t mean every set should go to failure (you’ll fatigue faster)… but sprinkling it in keeps your RIR honest and ensures you’re pushing hard enough to grow. ✅ My recommendation: 	•	Keep most sets at 1–2 RIR 	•	Occasionally take the last set to 0 RIR 	•	If you haven’t trained to failure in a while, try it once for every muscle group this week — you’ll be shocked at what you’ve been leaving in the tank. 💬 If you’re not sure how to structure your training & nutrition for consistent progress, that’s exactly what I do with my coaching clients.

The first three grips he shows trains your triceps in the same exact way. Your triceps main function is to extend the elbow. Changing your wrist positioning does not magically change which head of the tricep is working. The lateral and medial heads will be working no matter what kind of extension that you're doing. The only thing that matters is shoulder positioning for the long head of the tricep, which is the only one that crosses the shoulder joint. So when your arms are by your sides, you're training the long head in the shortened position. When your arms are overhead, you're training them in the lengthened position. You don't need four variations for triceps. You just need two movements, one with your arms by your sides, one with your arms overhead.",120000

Here’s the truth: 1️⃣ Any rep range can build muscle (5–30) as long as you train close to failure. 2️⃣ How many days a week you train doesn’t matter—consistency and lifestyle fit matter more. 3️⃣ Recovery is your secret weapon—sleep, stress, and nutrition are just as important as your workouts. Forget the “one best way” myths. Build muscle in a way that fits your life, train hard, and recover well.

Most of the best way to build muscle advice is blown way out of proportion. You don't need a specific number of reps to grow. If you're training close to failure, whether it's five reps or 30, you'll build muscle. Intensity matters more than rep range. Personally, I stick to low to moderate reps because I can hit the stimulating reps faster with less fatigue. Now how many days a week should you train? Whether it's three, four, five or six days, pick what you can actually stick to. I used to train six days a week. Now I train four to five. Sustainability wins every time. Lastly, recovery is the most underrated key to growth. You can do everything right in the gym, but if your sleep sucks, your stress is high, and you're under eating, your progress will stall.",120000

Things only changed when I asked: “What if I actually became the man I pretend I want to be?” It wasn’t motivation. It was identity. Now I train, I lead, I serve, and I keep my promises to myself.

Here’s how to warm up the right way so you can hit your top sets with max intent to get the most out of your training 💥  Save this & try it in your next workout 💪🏻 ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ #fitness #training #workout #warmups #mensfitness #onlinefitnesscoach #strengthtraining #musclebuildingtips ",1592,47,1,0,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,justinjfit,2025-07-05,1751751892,20,#fitness #training #workout #warmups #mensfitness #onlinefitnesscoach #strengthtraining #musclebuildingtips,original sound,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7523716987667696927,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/o4x0qINIGiAlzCnOAIeNAaB4jLeiZQIICUejap~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=ihPQUjT%2BPz9v2e%2BwbfLjcgl9Dss%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,,120000

I was spending 2+ hours in the gym chasing volume when I could’ve made better progress with half the time and effort. Eventually, it caught up to me. That much volume didn’t just waste time — it led to overuse injuries that took months to fully recover from. Here’s the truth: You don’t need more volume. You need enough volume — paired with intensity, progressive overload, and proper recovery. Start with the lowest amount of volume that still allows for progress. Then adjust based on your results — never go beyond what you can recover from. 👉 Rule of thumb: Most people make their best gains with 6–12 total sets per muscle group per week. If you’re consistently hitting 20+ sets, you’re likely doing more harm than good. 💡 Some signs you’re doing too much: – Always sore going into your next session – No progress on your final exercises – Strength plateauing or dropping Train hard. But train smart. Because more volume doesn’t always mean more gains — sometimes, it means more setbacks. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ #trainsmart #overtraining #bodybuilding #fitness #progressiveoverload #onlinecoach #fitnesstips #gymtips #gains #buildmuscle #workouttips #gymlife #gymrat #gymlifestyle",1805,79,1,1,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,justinjfit,2025-06-05,1749149651,58,#trainsmart #overtraining #bodybuilding #fitness #progressiveoverload #onlinecoach #fitnesstips #gymtips #gains #buildmuscle #workouttips #gymlife #gymrat #gymlifestyle,original sound,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7512540502462336286,https://p19-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/oAvB2naYKhR5EAVAbHZld05BYiwAEB9iII7KU~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=45l7QHlo2w74lCE2pfd4ogUuq0U%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"Back in college I used to do way too much volume. Like 16 sets just for chest alone and then I go into delts and triceps. So 2 plus hour sessions. And yeah it worked, but looking back it was overkill and I experienced a lot of overuse injuries later on. The truth is, I could have made just as much progress, if not more, with less time, less energy, and way less volume. These days, efficiency is everything. My priority isn't how long I'm training, it's how well I can train. Here's what I recommend start with the least amount of volume that still allows you to progress week to week. Usually two solid sets across one to three exercises per muscle group, depending on your split. And if you're still sore by the second session of the week, or you're consistently not progressing on the last few exercises of your workout, then you're probably doing too much volume. So train smarter, progress faster, and don't waste your time trying to out volume bad programming.",120000

Prioritize the long head. The long head of the bicep is what gives your arms that peaked look—and it’s best trained when the shoulders are slightly internally rotated. Here are 3 movements to target it: 🔹 Concentration Curls – Maximize tension and control with the shoulder internally rotated and elbow tucked against your leg. 🔹 Close-Grip Preacher Curls – A narrow grip shifts more load to the long head. Keep your form tight and squeeze at the top. 🔹 Cross-Body Hammer Curls – While this hits the brachialis too, the cross-body motion biases the long head and builds arm density underneath the biceps. I recommend hitting biceps with 2 exercises per session, twice a week. Pick 2 of these to split between your workouts, and pair them with 2 others of your choice 👌🏻 ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ #bicepworkout #armday #biceppeak #hypertrophytraining #bigarms #onlinecoach #gains #aesthetics #gymtips ",2961,126,3,3,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,justinjfit,2025-06-05,1749084899,17,#bicepworkout #armday #biceppeak #hypertrophytraining #bigarms #onlinecoach #gains #aesthetics #gymtips,original sound,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7512262391590063391,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/okKR6dXdGQhu4AeVAsLCqVjHvCe0QfIQINADIg~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=qYeMjkhX1SNfyft9%2FwXxmd3dyhE%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"Listen, I grind cause I gotta get paid. 1% chance, 99% faith.

They'll take a wide grip similar to a flat press, and they'll keep those elbows flared as they press, thinking that just because we're on an incline bench, we're going to be biasing the upper chest fibers, which isn't necessarily the case. Our middle to lower chest fibers love to have the elbows slightly more flared to bring those elbows across the body. And, yes, your upper chest is going to assist with that. But if you really want to bias the upper chest, we need more shoulder flexing. Our upper chest really helps us bring that. That elbow up and across the body. So if you want to bias the upper chest more, what you can do is bring that grip width in a little bit to be just outside of shoulder width. And this will allow you to tuck your elbows throughout the movement, bring in more shoulder flexion, which will give you better overall upper chest activation.",120000

You don’t need 5 variations every week—just smart execution 👌🏻 ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ #tricepsworkout #armday #buildmuscle #tricepstraining #fitnesseducation #longheadtriceps #hypertrophytips #smarttraining #mensfitnesstips #musclebuilding101",3029,114,1,3,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,justinjfit,2025-05-07,1746653543,47,#tricepsworkout #armday #buildmuscle #tricepstraining #fitnesseducation #longheadtriceps #hypertrophytips #smarttraining #mensfitnesstips #musclebuilding101,original sound,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7501819734631943454,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/okf40eCVGBEiAGWIAIxDy5ApnPiAWoLpBERbig~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=tfjvecNYf8ay0iRkqZ8Rrrj0VB4%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,"If you want massive arms, you need to build your triceps since they make up most of them, especially the long head, which is the biggest of the three heads. The triceps main job is elbow extension, but the long head also crosses the shoulder joint, so your shoulder position matters. That's why overhead movements like French presses or cable overhead extensions stretch the long head and train it in its lengthened position. Movements like rope push downs or cross body extensions train it in a more shortened position. JM presses are great for the lateral and medial head, but similar to other pressing movements, they don't effectively train the long head. So if you want crisp croissants for triceps, I like to do one overhead movement and one with arms by my sides. These should be the priority since the long head is the thickest and these will still train the lateral and medial heads. You can sprinkle in something like a J and press if you're lacking lateral head thickness, but you shouldn't need more than one to two triceps exercises per session two times per week.",120000

Let me clear it up for you. Your hamstrings do two main things. One, hip extension, think RDLS2. Knee flexion, think leg curls. Except for the short head of the biceps femoris, which only crosses the knee. So yes, you need both movement patterns when it comes to exercise selection. Do seated leg curls if you can. They lock you in hip flexion, so you're training the hamstrings in a stretch position, which is great for growth. If you don't have one lying, leg curls work too. For hip extension, go with the stiff leg deadlifts or 45 degree hip hinges. The key is keeping the knee relatively fixed while the hips move. Here's what not to do leg presses for hamstrings. They combine knee flexion and hip extension, meaning the length of the hamstrings stay the same, so you don't get a good stretch or contraction. In other words, no real stimulus. If you're serious about growing your hamstrings, don't neglect your leg curls and hip hinges.",120000

Research shows muscle activation is significantly lower during the eccentric phase than the concentric phase. While some eccentric control is important for technique and injury prevention, excessively slow eccentrics can reduce total training volume by forcing you to use lighter loads. Why does that matter? Mechanical tension — the key driver of hypertrophy — is compromised when you sacrifice load or concentric effort just to slow the lowering phase. That doesn’t mean you should neglect the eccentric altogether. Controlled eccentrics matter — just not prolonged eccentrics. Your best bet? Lower the weight under control (1-2 seconds is plenty), then focus on producing maximum force during the concentric phase — where most muscle-building stimulus occurs. Don’t waste energy on tempo for tempo’s sake. Use eccentrics to reinforce solid technique — not to slow your gains. #hypertrophytraining #musclebuildingtips #musclegrowth #transformationcoach #gains #muscle #workouttips",68600,475,63,12,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,Majorzin dos beats,2025-03-27,1743083456,11,#hypertrophytraining #musclebuildingtips #musclegrowth #transformationcoach #gains #muscle #workouttips,AURA,AURA,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7486486369007701279,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast8-p-0068-tx2/oc37fAD5GVbE8FRrnl1ddBVEAInlBNFIlrfVE8~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=MaVUVQKMkCevLHoFiiarTjNrRZI%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,,120000

Manage stress with meditation, deep breathing, and walks. 🧘‍♂️ 6️⃣ Avoid Endocrine Disruptors – BPA, plastics, and pesticides can mess up your hormones. Use glass, stainless steel cookware, wooden cutting boards, wash your produce, and go organic when possible. 🚫🧴 7️⃣ Don’t Overtrain – More isn’t always better. Train hard, recover harder. Your body (and testosterone) will thank you. ✅ 8️⃣ Get Vitamin D, Zinc & Magnesium – Low in these? Your test levels are suffering. Get sunlight daily and consider supplementing. ☀️ 9️⃣ Eat Testosterone-Boosting Foods – Eggs, shellfish, lean meats, spinach, and nuts = better hormone balance. 🍳🥩 🔟 Stay Hydrated – Dehydration spikes cortisol, reduces performance, and lowers testosterone.

Here are 10 ways to naturally maximize your testosterone. 1. Prioritize sleep. Deep sleep is when your body produces the most testosterone, so fix your sleep schedule. If you're not getting seven to nine hours of sleep, your testosterone is probably taking a hit. 2. Lift heavy and do hit. Focus on compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, rows, and bench press variations three to five times per week. Three. Eat more healthy fats. Stop fearing fats. Your body needs them for hormone production. No.. 4. Stay lean. Excess body fat increases estrogen and crushes your testosterone. 5. Reduce stress. 6. Avoid endocrine disruptors. These are plastics, pesticides, and personal care products that include chemicals like BPAs that wreck your hormones. 7. Don't over train. 8. Get vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium. 9. Eat testosterone boosting foods. Eggs, shellfish, lean meat, spinach, and nuts provide essential nutrients that support testosterone production. 10. Stay hydrated.",120000

I wouldn't only eat chicken, rice, eggs, and oatmeal. I did this for a while because I thought it was the best way to see results, but all it did was burn me out on some great foods that I literally couldn't eat for at least a year. I'd stick to the same workouts for at least four to 12 weeks at a time. Sticking to a plan allows you to track weights, apply progressive overload, and actually build strength over time time. 4. I wouldn't overlook the basics. Prioritize sleep, hydration, daily movement, and vitamins. Makes a huge difference. 5. I'd stop comparing myself to others.

Because it trains the hamstrings in their stretched position, which research suggests is more beneficial for growth. 💡 Here’s the breakdown: 	•	Seated Leg Curl: Stretched position = more growth potential. 	•	Lying Leg Curl: Shortened position = great for isolating and squeezing the muscle. 	•	Best Practice? Use BOTH for well-rounded development! 👉 If you’re doing a movement like a Romanian deadlift in your workout (which also trains the hamstrings from a stretched position but focuses on hip extension), pairing it with a lying leg curl can give you balance by focusing on knee flexion in the shortened position. Think of your hamstrings as the biceps of your legs—you want to train them in both their stretched and shortened positions for maximum results! 💪🦵 💬 Which is your go-to: seated or lying leg curls?

What's the better option for your hamstrings? Let's break it down. The seated leg curl trains your hamstrings in their stretched position. Now, why does this matter? Training a muscle in its stretched position can generally lead to better overall growth. The lying leg curl trains the hamstrings in their shortened position like a preacher curl does for your biceps. Both have value, and ideally you'll include both in your program for balanced development. If I could only pick one, I'd choose the seated leg curl for its greater growth potential. However, if you're doing an exercise like the Romanian deadlift in the same workout, which also trains the hamstrings from a shortened position but focuses on hip extension, you could pair it with the lying leg curl to train knee flexion from the shortened position.

Here’s our Sleep-Optimizing Night Routine 💤 We’ve found that when we’re consistent with this routine, our sleep quality (and how we feel the next day) improves SO much. While we’re not perfect every night, sticking to these habits as often as possible has been a game-changer for us. Here’s what we do: 1.	Start with herbal tea 🍵 – This signals to our bodies that it’s time to wind down and relax. 2.	Skincare and oral hygiene 🧴🪥 – Taking care of ourselves helps us feel fresh and ready for rest. 3.	Say goodnight to the pups 🐾 – A moment of love and connection with our furry family before bed. 4.	Get in bed 60+ minutes before sleep ⏳ – It gives us time to transition from the stress of the day to recovery. 5.	Journal and plan the next day 📝 – Clearing our minds and setting intentions helps us sleep peacefully. 6.	Dim the lights or wear blue light blockers 😎 – This reduces stimulation and preps us for sleep. 7.	Take time to chill TF out 🛋️ – Letting go of the day’s stress is essential for both our minds and bodies. 	8.	Goodnight kisses 😘 – Ending the day with love and connection is one of our favorite habits. 	9.	Set a 30-minute TV timer 📺 – A little light entertainment helps us unwind before drifting off. We’re far from perfect, but the more consistent we are with these steps, the better we sleep and feel overall.

Flat Machine Press - 3-4 sets x 6-10 reps • Similar approach here: push hard but stay controlled. 3. Low to High Cable Fly - 3-4 sets x 10-15 reps • Start light to feel the connection, then increase weight each set. This is just a framework to build on. Focus on getting close to failure with good form, gradually increase weight and reps when you can, and feel free to switch exercises if you need a new stimulus. Good luck with the gains!

The aches, low energy, and fear of long-term issues are only going to get worse if you don’t act now. 2. Setting an example for your kids – Your kids are watching. Do you want them to grow up with the same unhealthy habits or to struggle with their weight and confidence like you have? 3. Building confidence – You’ve spent too long feeling uncomfortable in your own skin. Fitness isn’t just about looking better; it’s about regaining that lost confidence and feeling proud of yourself. 4. Staying disciplined – Every time you quit, it chips away at your self-belief. Sticking to your fitness goals proves to yourself that you can follow through when it matters most. 5. Managing stress and mental health – You’re carrying stress like a weight on your shoulders, and it’s affecting your mood, your relationships, and your performance. Fitness gives you a release and mental clarity you desperately need. 6. Creating a sustainable lifestyle – You’ve tried the crash diets, quick fixes, and strict regimens. They’ve all failed because they weren’t sustainable. What you need is a lifestyle that fits into the life you’re actually living. 7. Boosting energy and productivity – If you’re always tired, it’s holding you back in every area of your life. Imagine how much more you could accomplish if you didn’t feel like you were running on empty. 8. Improving quality of life – The simple joys—playing with your kids, enjoying vacations, feeling confident in your clothes—are slipping away.

Here’s a simple way to break through it: Constant dieting can slow your metabolism and ramp up hunger, making fat loss feel impossible. You spend weeks, maybe months, eating less and working harder—only to lose a few pounds and gain it all back. This happens because you skip the crucial build phase. You’re always trying to eat less and move more, not realizing how much that can hurt your progress in the long run. This is why in Phase 3 of my coaching system, we focus on eating more strategically to build muscle, boost your metabolism, and set your body up for long-term fat loss. It may sound counterintuitive, but this is what got so many of my clients off the dieting hamster wheel. 1. Start by adding at least 2-3 strength workouts per week focusing compound exercises like squats, presses, and rows. 2. Up your protein intake—aim for .8-1g per pound of body weight 3. Gradually increase your calories by 100-200 at a time to fuel growth. Building muscle isn’t just about getting stronger. It’s the key to speeding up your metabolism, achieving a lean, toned look, and breaking through those frustrating fat loss plateaus. Ready to boost your metabolism and break that plateau?

One meal won’t derail your progress—it’s all about consistency over time. The real setback is feeling guilty or ashamed for enjoying some pizza. That kind of mindset can create a negative cycle and lead to an unhealthy relationship with food. Focus on eating mostly whole foods because they help you feel your best (and you can still make them delicious!). But there’s no need to completely restrict yourself from foods you love. When you allow flexibility in your diet, it feels less like a strict plan and more like a sustainable lifestyle—and that makes staying consistent so much easier.

Side delts should be a top priority for rounding out your shoulders since they get little stimulation outside of lateral raises and upright rows. Aim for 4-8 sets across 1-2 exercises 2 x per week. 2. Front delts don’t require much work if you’re training chest with adequate volume. Hitting 3-4 sets of shoulder presses once per week is enough for many people. If you find your front delts are lacking,  you can add in an extra day of shoulder presses or front raises. 3. Rear delts will be getting some activation through shoulder extension during back workouts, but we’re missing out on the horizontal abduction & external rotation component. Hit 3-4 sets of reverse fly’s (horizontal abduction) 1-2x per week Hit 3-4 sets of face pulls (external rotation) 1-2x per week The amount of sets performed per session should be determined by the amount of volume you can properly recover from.

And so constantly improving myself is like a defense mechanism to ensure that I am good enough for whoever or whatever situation comes my way. And growing up, you know, that started out as baseball and other sports and made jujutsu course video games. That's why I loved RPGs and competitive online, because it gave me that sense of progression, you know? Then it became about putting myself in the gym, building my body and school, learning, building my business. And there can be some other things that aren't quite as necessarily productive, but not everything has to be right. I love that I'm getting better at the saxophone, chess. I still really enjoy video games, but, you know, we don't want to put too much time towards that, or it can give you a false sense of progression. But I'm telling you guys, like, anytime I've been really, really depressed, it was probably because I allowed myself to get too comfortable. And so I've just realized I cannot allow myself to get to that point ever again. That's not safe, trust me. I love chilling, I love vacations, I love traveling, exploring. But it's just the matter of maintaining that momentum when I'm in my normal routine. And, of course, you know, those planned times away. That's great. I can enjoy those for what They are. But it's all about why you're in your routine. No matter what is going on, you keep the momentum going.",120000

The first pic was already two years into my fitness journey, but I was inconsistent before this point. I lacked confidence I was lazy And my main reason for hitting the gym was to look suitable for girls. The gym was not a “love at first sight” scenario. Like most people, starting at the gym was an obligatory task. It wasn’t until I got so frustrated by my bullshit excuses that I decided to take action. I was tired of wasting time I was scared to miss out on potential progress And I was sick of feeling like shit about myself. I had stopped & started various times within those first two years, but this time was different. I was finally doing this for myself. So I committed to hitting the gym for 30 days straight (even just for cardio & abs) and never looked back. Little did I know that this seemingly small goal would blossom into a burning passion that gave me a purpose in life. Fully dedicating myself to the gym and seeing more progress than I ever had through half-ass efforts was the first step in realizing I could not only mold my body to my liking but, more importantly, create the life I wanted to live. That’s why I’m an online fitness & mindset coach—I want to help you experience a life-changing breakthrough like I did.

Many people think they’re training at the intensity needed to promote muscle growth, but in reality, they’re leaving at least 3-5 reps left in the tank.

Not only to assess form but to gauge intensity & make sure they’re pushing themselves enough. This doesn’t mean you must hit failure every set, but you should be close. I always recommend at least pushing to failure by the last set of an exercise as long as it’s safe (with good form, of course).

These three things make that reasonably simple to accomplish 👇🏻 1. Prioritize lifting over cardio - lifting builds and maintains muscle. The more muscle we have, the more calories we burn at rest, making it easier to stay in a deficit (+ you’ll look better). If you’re dropping weight without lifting, you’ll likely lose muscle. 2. Track your intake - this is the best way to ensure you’re in a deficit (& eating enough protein) without being overly restrictive with food. Aim for 300-500 calories below maintenance to start. There are plenty of online calculators to figure this out 👌🏻 3. Hit 8-10k steps daily - walking is the most underrated form of exercise and an almost effortless way to burn more calories. Add two 10-15 min walks into your day and try to get up & move around a little every hour. You can incorporate 3-5 15-20 min  cardio sessions into your week if needed, but make lifting the priority.

I average 8-12 sets per workout for chest 2x per week. Each rep focuses on controlling the weight, and I perform every set to failure. Here’s the explanation 👇🏻 1. Starting with 6-8 reps on an incline or flat machine press - this allows me to move heavy ass weight with an excellent mind-muscle connection since I don’t have to worry about stabilizing and minimizes the risk of injury. 2. I move on to 8-10 reps of incline or flat DB press - if I started with an incline, I’ll do flat here & vice versa. As you get deeper into a workout, you can’t lift as heavy anyway, and I like the idea of not having to use as much weight on a riskier exercise. Plus, I notice I connect better vs. hitting it first. 3. Finish with a mid or high cable fly - this is based on the priority for the day. If I started with an incline press, I’d finish with a high/incline fly & vice versa. This is the final opportunity to gas out my chest, so I like to finish with partial reps at the end of each set 🔥 My first chest workout of the week is upper machine, flat db, high cable fly, and my second workout is the opposite. Then I’ll finish up with front/side delts & triceps 👌🏻 Try it out & let me know what you think 👊🏻 ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ 1:1 Online Coaching 👇🏻 Tap link in my bio to start your transformation #fitness #onlinecoach #chestworkout #aesthetics #workouttips #exercisetips #gains #buildmuscle ",3838,248,3,2,thejustinjfit,6619727059488309254,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit,MS4wLjABAAAAgWLBvdt38P0X4aMxi6FAFMrOgFkoyWRvlfhyF_kmyqzfeQobt_SggFB3OKbt9zjv,,2024-01-19,1705629356,13,#fitness #onlinecoach #chestworkout #aesthetics #workouttips #exercisetips #gains #buildmuscle,,,1080,1920,0.56,https://www.tiktok.com/@thejustinjfit/video/7325622204073315630,https://p16-common-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast5-p-0068-tx/621be0ad8389452d9c5ed7e7cb8bef5a_1705629358~tplv-tiktokx-origin.image?dr=9636&x-expires=1762056000&x-signature=jK7rVMJZ8W5JVArgQu4xhVR4Pi0%3D&t=4d5b0474&ps=13740610&shp=81f88b70&shcp=43f4a2f9&idc=useast8,,120000

And no, I'm not lying. I've been so busy, but they look super amazing still. But I saw these about two weeks ago and I had to book my appointment and get these done. They actually didn't have the same exact colour, but they got so close. My pedicure was up first, so I just got the same colour but without the chrome because I wasn't sure if it was gonna look good on my toes. And then she was like, do you wanna do French? And I said, hell yeah, I do. And they make the best French tips I've ever seen in my life. Like they're so perfect for my nails. I was getting square for a while and I decided to do the almond nail. I was just like her. I'm glad I did. And look at this colour before the chrome. It is so classy. I literally feel 10 times more luxurious when I get a Russian manicure. So I was already loving them. I almost decided to just stay with that colour, but I was like, no, I'm gonna do the chrome because I've been wanting it. And I'm so glad I did because they look so beautiful. These are also my real nails on builder gel. They just look amazing and I'm so glad I go with them still. Like I'm obsessed every single time I go. It doesn't get better than this.",570000

When I just started my fitness journey, it was super gym rat lifestyle all over TikTok and Instagram. I found out I had hypothyroidism, which just made things even harder for me. One week I'd lose two to three pounds and the next I'd gain around 7. My weight fluctuated a lot, but that didn't stop me. I knew that I could get to my goals. I just had to find the way that worked best for my body. First thing I had to do was to stop training like a man. Yeah, I said it now. Don't come for me. I still weight lift, but I don't weight lift more than 2 to 3 times a week. And I definitely don't when I'm close to my period or on my period. I'm not just exercising 2 to 3 times a week, but I do Pilates instead. And I'm not saying that Pilates is the miracle here. At the end of the day, it takes discipline, is low impact. It's not going to make you super tired or hungry. So it just made my diet a lot better. Hence why I reduced the amount of heavy lifting I was doing. And I decided to do something that I genuinely love. Not saying you need to do Pilates, but something low impact for you can definitely make a difference. I don't care if people get technical about it, but the mix of Pilates and strength training was just the right amount of exercise for me to feel good and not be burnt out. I know I'm going out to eat or to drink that night. Honestly, I eat a lot leaner during the day. It's just the truth. I will eat probably mainly protein and fiber, real super filling meals, but nothing too crazy so I can save a little bit more and enjoy a little bit more in the afternoon. Also, this might be weird, but I eat out a lot more than I do eat at home than most fitness influencers. I grew up loving to eat outside food and the only way I'm genuinely satisfied sometimes is going out and eating food outside of my home. They're the same way where you can't work unless you go to a cafe. And I'm gonna say it, I do have the same thing where I taste everything, eat nothing. I'm not actually eating nothing. It's just something I say. Because at the end of the day, you cannot eat that much. If you are short, not burning a bunch of calories throughout the day and want to be slim, comment down below if you want a little checklist of every single thing I do every week to stay on track.",570000

It's gorgeous, but I felt like I didn't get entirely everything I wanted the first time. Wanted to give it another chance. So I got their two week intro. As a certified Pilates instructor, is it worth it to me? I think it definitely is. I haven't tried all instructors, but Hattie is 100% my favourite and I am loyal to her. Now I pretty sure she's the founder or one of the owners of Halo and she is absolutely amazing at her job. I feel amazing. I feel stronger. And you can tell she really cares about you getting better in Pilates and seeing improvements in your body. This girl really does do a lot more real Pilates than any other instructor I've seen at Halo so far. She just adds a little bit of pulses, a little bit of back to full range movements, which I actually really preferred from her. Genuinely, my mind is blown and I am thinking about getting a membership here.",570000

Here I have Starbucks's new protein cold foam. They have a protein iced coffee and protein cold foam. First one I got was the iced sugar free vanilla latte. Supposedly this has protein inside of it. Ariana Grande, there is almost 30 grams of protein. I got a tall just to try them out. So let's try this one first. I would give this one probably like a 5 to 6 out of 10. It's not bad. I definitely feel like I could have made this in my own house just adding an espresso shot. And then the Fairlife drink, I don't think I would get it again though. It's the chocolate protein cold brew and it has chocolate protein on top. The only thing I'm not happy about is that a grande has almost 300 to 400 calories and it has a lot of sugar. I actually do like this one. I would probably give it like a 7 out of 10, this one. If I was feeling mocha of some sort, I think I would grab this one again. But again, I would modify it and add a sugar free syrups instead. And lastly, this is the one I'm excited about. It's the Iced Banana Protein Matcha Latte, Banana Cream cold foam on top. Again, outrageous with the sugar and the calories unfortunately. But I'm sure you can definitely modify this one. This one is definitely my Favorite one? I'd give this one like an 8 out of 10. Taste the same as an iced matcha latte with classic and cold foam on top. All of these need to be lower in calories. It kind of just loses the whole point of everything. Comment, which one's your favorite? Did you like them? Which one did you absolutely hate?",570000

Starting off with this outfit from define. I'm convinced this color looks beautiful on every single body. Seriously, my favorite collection. Next is the LA Roche Posay 50 SPF Tinted Mineral Light Fluid Sunscreen. This is the only thing I put on before teaching my hot mat classes. Enough to be like a light foundation almost. And that's what I put on so I don't look extra crusty when I'm working out. Still cute enough to wear sets like these. Comes to more fitness or health related. These. Magnesium L threonates from symbiosis. This is my third pack with them. These. Honestly, I feel like I am able to go work out every single day now and not be extremely sore because I take these. Whatever collection this is, it's kind of like a mesh, see through kind of thing. I have it in black as well, and I also have the long sleeves in white, black, and navy. They are just basic go to's. I feel like they give that like, model, like, casual look that we're always looking for with like jeans or some shorts. It's just a go to, especially if you have your hair done, jewelry done. It's just one of those staples. My favorite purse at the moment is the Pauline one. I've been wanting this since last year and I finally got my hands on it. I feel like this is the perfect size because of My job on the go all day, whether that is teaching private sessions, going to teach at a studio, or then going to school. So this is my go to, and it's just really put together. Look, this is probably my number one most obsessing right now. And as I got a Nanoplastia, which is basically hair Botox, I got this about a month ago, and I'm absolutely in love. I blow dry my hair in less than 10 minutes, and then I just curl the ends like that with my Dyson. I think it just looks so good. It literally cuts my time span of getting in ready by like 70%. Lastly, is anything from better me. These are their ankle weights especially. I'm convinced better me is a million times better than Bala. I said it. I don't like Bala. I love better me. The only thing I would not get from better me, if you are into Pilates, is their mats. They're a little bit too thin in my opinion, but their equipment is top tier.

I used to suffer from binge eating, and I don't binge eat anymore. I have not binge ate in years. But that doesn't mean that I do not overeat very often. When I gain back this weight, I will eat crumble cookies, I will eat Chili's, and I will overdo it, like, to the point where I feel not good in my stomach. Like, I feel gross. Again, not binge eating, cause we all know that binge eating is something where you're eating an insane amount of calories in one sitting. This is just over time. I am eating way too much alcohol, Chili's, McDonald's, all of that stuff when I shouldn't be. I feel my best mentally, physically, and everything when I am usually around five to seven pounds lighter, because I'm actually listening to my body.

Today I tried out I am equals X Pilates in Lake Nona. They also have one in Maitland, and I will say this place actually does tea. It's real Pilates. It's done on a different kind of reformer. I've never been on before, but I didn't mind it at all. The instructor was insanely knowledgeable, the workouts were perfect, and although I can tell the place is not supposed to give such aesthetic vibes like it is nowadays, it's definitely for an older crowd. And it's a little bit slower pace. I could definitely level up a little little bit only and how many repetitions we do. But other than that, this is real Pilates, I think it's a great start for someone who is intimidated by Pilates and wants to take things slow.",570000

It's been going really well. I actually have not weighed myself and I'm really excited to. I just haven't gone to the gym, which is where the scale is. I don't actually have one at home. Feel like I've gotten a lot leaner and a lot slimmer. So I'm gonna take you along my day. I just show you guys what my food consists of to get to the goals that I want. Starting off with my usual iced coffee. Today I made it at home. This is only around 70 calories. It's basically two shots of espresso, some almond milk, a splash of brown sugar, shaken espresso creamer, and then zero sugar whipped cream with cinnamon on top. We have to leave in about 10 minutes to go teach three hot mat classes. So good luck to me. It I finished teaching three hammock classes. Had to scream with my voice cause the mic wasn't working. But we're finally having my first meal, which is this meal prep. It is basically like a lasagna kind of thing in like a bell pepper. It has broccoli and rice too, with some beef. And this is 450 calories, 36 grams of protein. I have to teach a private after this. If you live in Florida, um, I highly suggest them. My code is Savon. You get 50% off. Now I didn't have any of the rice just cause I got full Already. And then later on, I had a little bit of my meal prep. This is the Japanese noodles with the steak. And I only had half of this. I didn't talk cause I was eating next to my dad. And then I had little girls night. I had two cocktails. These are all with vodka, like martinis. This place was super bougie, though. They had this like rice paper fried thing. We also shared these appetizers. So we had half of everything. Two oysters, half of the hamachi. And then we also shared this cucumber salad. And I was really sad cause this was one exact scallop, but we shared it.",570000

This is my review and what I think of it. First off, they do use reformers. Traditional reformers. They don't use something like an exformer or the grid, which to me was a very good sign that this is actually Pilates. But I'm not gonna lie, I did expect something different. It's not that I was really turned down, but it. It was basically a modern Pilates workout on a traditional reformer. You don't know what I mean? This is an X former, and the one I'm on is a reformer. This is completely two different machines. You work out the same way you would on an X former, but on a traditional. Really? Like the instructor, like, genuinely, she was a really good instructor, but I was thinking it was gonna have the in go of actual Pilates and not have, like, four counts and then full range and then pulses. If you like that, then this studio definitely is for you. One principle of Pilates is flexibility, and I feel like there was none of that in the class, which is nothing against the instructor. Definitely expect more movement, a lot of foreshadowing onto what movement comes next. And modern Pilates lingo.",570000

There's some words that you think about when you think of like a really nice designer brand. I think of legacy, about craftsmanship. I know a lot of the products are probably like handmade. People check them over and over again to make sure the quality is there, okay? The design is there. And that's why we pay top dollar. We pay our top coins for these designer items, right? Like you would never walk into Bottega and be like, where's the diversity? Where's the accessibility, babe? There is no accessibility. This is Bottega. Okay? I want you to think the same way about classes. Basically, through a good program, takes 500 hours minimum. Things like degree and solid core are more successful, right? They took away a little bit of the craftsmanship of the reformer and turned it into a megaformer. Now hire a little bit less experience in training out of instructors. That's okay because now more people can do it. The Raven's video for Pilates went viral and I've gotten multiple people ask me, what are my thoughts on this as a certified Pilates instructor? So this is going to be my beliefs and what I think went wrong in this video. So basically she's trying to compare Pilates to a place like Bottega where it is a luxury. You're paying for that space is for the quality of the equipment and for the 500+ hour Trainings for that Pilates instructor. I completely get that it is very difficult to make Pilates extreme. Only affordable if you're going to a studio that offers reformer, springboard, mat, all the equipment for you, including the trainer who needs to get paid for those hours, including the thousands of dollars it cost to get your certification. But I do say a lot of these studios do go to a really big extent cause they know that a lot of women who go to Pilates have money. But the issue here is when she says if someone asked where's the diversity and she goes, babe, there is no diversity, it's Boteca. That's where I don't agree. I don't really see how that is relevant with Pilates because one thing is designer and Pilates is a movement and it's not exclusive. She also mentioned that Lagree and places that have mega formers or X formers are more successful nowadays because they're a little bit on the cheaper side, more affordable. When she mentioned that in addition to diversity, it's what makes me feel like, oh, the people that make a space diverse are only going to these cheaper low class places. I think diversity is completely irrelevant when it comes to this. It doesn't mean another style or another place is less than, you're just different. But you should definitely know why you're doing one movement and why you're doing the other. And just to be clear, I'm not always the Best with words. And I usually don't talk about things like this that are controversial because I am not good at using my words. Always love here. And my goal and my page is to always make everyone feel as welcome as possible. Any gender, size, fitness level, race is welcome in a fitness space. No matter what age, gender, whatever you're into, find a space that makes you feel welcome, makes you feel good and just keep going there.",570000

Welcome to cutting diaries part. What is it, 9 now? Guys, the results are showing. I'm also on my period though, which kind of sucks. But I'm weighing myself tomorrow. Workout wise, I started off and I taught three hot mat classes. I say I didn't put as much effort as usual because I'm on my period. And after teaching that, I was able to finally have my first meal at 1:30. Wasn't much though, because I had to leave right after this. So I had my usual potato, cheddar, whatever, egg bites. I got them from Costco. This was the world's worst avocado. Like, I'm not even kidding. I cut it up, I put lime and stuff, but it tasted horrendous, so I did not eat it. Just the egg bite. Finally when I had more time on my hands, I cooked us some shrimp cause it's really easy to make, and had it with some leftover rice and Greek salad. Forgot to film it, but I had this exact order. Again. It's just my sugar free peach green tea with lychee jelly. And then later on I went to a strength and tone Pilates class. So it's a little bit of foot work and a lot of upper body and legs, like squatting, strength, all of that good stuff. Got home and I had some leftover chicken with a little bit of this, like udon noodle stir fry and veggies. Super good. And then for Dessert I just air fried a peach and I added low calorie maple pecan ice cream from target. It's such an easy, low calorie dessert. Definitely try it out. Really good day overall.",570000

This is episode 8 of my cutting series. This time I'm making it a little fun and only eating at Wawa for 24 hours. So it wasn't that fun. But for my workout of the day, I went at 7 a. M. To a hot mat sculpt class that kicked my butt. And the first thing I got was the zero sugar salted caramel latte from Wawa. And I custom made a plain bagel with eggs, Turkey bacon and jalapeno. I also added light veggie cream cheese. I did have breakfast earlier than I usually do. Then for a quick grab and go, I got a Lunchables. I felt like I was back in school again. And I got a zero sugar peachy green tea that slapped. At this point, I was really annoyed that I was still eating Wawa, but I got their chicken bowl. To me it's like the same as like a Chipotle bowl. It has beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, chicken and other than that, and I ate it up. And then afterwards for a little dessert, I had a Greek yogurt bar Cleo. I've had these before. They're pretty good. They have 8 grams of protein and they kind of taste like cheesecake. Overall, towards the end of the day, my body started not to feel good, but I did stay in my deficit. So a win is a win.",570000

Then my favourite, the hundreds. This is modified. This is intermediate. And then legs at 45 for more advanced, for a mini combo. You curl up, left leg will extend as a right arm curls. And then you lower all the way down as you do that side. Then you're gonna switch to the next side, do the same exact thing, and then you're gonna can, can. So you're gonna reach to one side, extend the legs to the opposite, come back down, and then switch. And then this is your finisher. You stay on one side, you pulse it out for about 10 seconds, do the other side, and you are done. It burns like crazy, but you're gonna love it. Let me know if you try it.",570000

Welcome to cutting Diaries, Episode 7. The cut has been cutting. As you see, I started my day off with this new fall drink I made. It is so good. The same amount of calories as my usual drink. And then after teaching three hot Pilates classes, I ordered a Coke with a poke bowl. It has so many things, salmon, crab, tuna, cream cheese, seaweed salad, edamame, avocado, rice and mango. And this is all that I had left. I ended up having even less than half of the coat and that's on portion controlling. After that, I went to work in my usual place, had my usual sugar free green tea. And then this was a early dinner. I had Longhorn Steakhouse. Of course, I had to have some of bread. So everything here is what I had, just a little bit of the bread, a little bit of the butter. And as one of my sides, I got the Caesar salad. This is all that was left from that. For my main, I asked for the salmon, rice and asparagus. Of course, I didn't end up finishing this all. I was full but not too full. That's the goal here. I had a bunch of water. I've been sipping water after every single meal that I have. That's about it. I took that to go. I did feel a little bloated afterwards, though, so I had some mint tea to end it off. And That is all. Unfortunately, I didn't work out for myself today, but that is it.",570000

And today's restaurant, we have Longhorn Steakhouse. So let's go inside. So, of course, the evil bread. You're gonna grab a little bit of butter, a little bit of bread, put it on your plate, and then move it to the side. If you're someone like I used to be who just doesn't get satiated easily, try to sip on water after every single food you have. Most places have one to two sides. Mine had three. So when it comes to that, always make sure you have more veggies than carbs in there. You don't need to finish it. You're real meal is coming soon. The salmon is 300 calories, the rice is around 230, and the asparagus is around 130. The kicker is listening to your hunger cues. So basically, a whole meal. I'm full, but I'm not too full. Now, even though this is a much lower calorie meal than most things in Longhorn, that doesn't mean you need to automatically calculate it into your tracker. Enjoy the meal, and right before you are too full, stop and take it to go.",570000

And I found out they have them in Costco, so I did buy them at Costco. And this has been my go to recently for my source of slow caffeine. It's a sugar free peach green tea with lychee jelly. And I just sit and work for hours on my laptop, on my phone, editing emails, school, etcetera. Okay, yeah, this is really sad, but I literally had no time. So this is what I had for lunch. It's a tomato mozzarella. And then I had to go to class. Yep, I'm a college girl, if you didn't know. And then I got this from agave as well. I needed my protein girl. So I had all the beans, almost all of the steak. There was yuca fries that I didn't show.

You're doing half roll downs and then you're gonna hold it at the bottom and add oblique twists. You should be leaned back enough where you start to feel a little bit of shakes. Then we'll do some leg Scissors. You're holding onto the arc. You'll feel a stretch in the back of your legs too. Then side line kicks, you'll definitely feel it with the ankle weights. Flex the foot and pulse it forward twice and then point it to bring it back. This one's a fun one but actually really hard. You add two pulses at the bottom and then press up, reach the arms forward holding your plank. You're going to pulse one leg up two times and then switch it out and then you end it off with side planking to each side slowly staggering the top leg over the bottom and repeat this one more time.",570000

Fair warning, it is pretty expensive. Then we headed on over to Nintendo World, and I got the red lamb shell. It's basically a calzone. It's extremely hot, extremely delicious, though. Not a fan of the Red 40, but, yeah, it has sausage, tomato, and melted cheese. It tastes like pizza. And I'm not gonna lie, a lot of this was really expensive. That's all I had here at the park. But I will be coming back soon for a part two.",570000

Your girl does not like to have her wavy, curly hair. It's just a mess all the time. I want it to be straight 24 7. And so you guys see, this is right after washing my hair, and this is right after doing the treatment. You would think I lied if I told you she didn't even straighten my hair. I'm gonna share with you the process. So first she starts off with the mixture. She'll part your hair and then put it all throughout your hair and let it sit for about 45 minutes. She'll then take you to the sink and just lightly rinse your hair. She doesn't take all the product out. And then with low or high heat, she'll start to dry, dry your hair and then straighten it. When she straightens it, she's kind of getting the product into your hair more. Then she'll take you into the sink again and genuinely wash your hair. And then that's when you dry it. When I tell you it took less than 10 minutes to dry my hair, this is exactly how my hair looked after just drying it. No straightening after that. I promise. She swear airs by it. It's healthier for your hair. And if you wash your hair, you'll just dry it in 10 minutes, and it'll look exactly like this. For Six months",570000

I'm starting with 45 pounds on each side. I'm gonna have my feet slightly turned out just so I can press against my heels a little bit more. No arching happening, right? So you're just gonna bend at the knees, hinge at the hips, down, exhale slowly, come up. You're holding it up for two seconds, and then you come all the way back down again. Hold it at the top for five, four, three, two, one. Okay, that is set number one. Alright, so for this next one, we're gonna do for today, just because I'm getting back into this, eight sets of every single thing we do. So we're gonna do eight hip thrust, eight bee stances on one leg, eight on the other. And that's it. We got those eight real slow. One more. Alright, we're holding it up. We're gonna be stance, heel is out, toe is turned out. We pulse it up and down. One, 7, 8, and then we stop. We're gonna do that one more time. That was hard. 8 hip thrust, 8 B stances each leg, and then eight pulses at the center. Again, 8 B stance, 1, 7, 8. Switch it out. One, 7, 8, center. Pulse it. One, two, five, eight. Whoo! Ah! It's what happens when you put a Pilates instructor into strength training. Whoo! I'm done.",570000

First things first, I was really on the go all day today. I packed some cottage cheese with two boiled eggs and some cucumber. Honestly, I had this in the car while I was on the way to Starbucks. Of course, their fall menu just came out, so first drink I tried from them is the pecan crunch. Whatever one. I did modify it, which I posted earlier today. I managed to find some room to have lunch, which was this meal prep tuna. I had half of that. And the soup is super easy to make. It's just sweet potato and carrot, basically. Then before class, I had this Chobani flip. Forgot I had to film a video of me eating this three wishes cereal. So I had a little bit of that, nothing too crazy. And to hold me off until dinner, I had this container of hearts of palm. And then I had more of that sweet potato soup with blue cheese. I know it's a really weird combo, but I love it. And then I ended it off with one. Just one of this soft baked chocolate chip cookie from Favourite Day. I'm really close to my period, so I'm really craving sweets, but that is all I did. I ended up not being able to work out, unfortunately. That's A lie? I could have, but I was so busy today that I just didn't get the energy to. Which is super normal. A diet is key. At the end of the day.",570000

So I'm back on my shit. The last time I was on a cut was around February. It's definitely time for a new one. This is episode one, day one of my cutting series. First off, right before I taught three hot mat classes, I had my one sole electrolyte that I have every single day. Having electrolytes ensures that I have enough hydration in my body. And if there's enough hydration in my body, I can check off one of the things that won't give me more cravings. I started meal prepping a little bit again. So I did make this tuna salad with this Greek yogurt, and I had ordered some seaweed salad from the day before that I didn't eat and some gluten free crackers to go with this. That is when I went to my pole class. I would say that the hot mat classes and the pole class that I did makes it enough to equate to 10 k steps in a day. After I finished the pole, I got my usual iced brown sugar shaken espresso with non dairy cold foam. Now something else I had prepped is sweet potato and ground beef. So I had some sweet potato, ground beef, cottage cheese, and avocado. We already know this combo is amazing for my actual workout of the day to work my muscles and get stronger. I Went to a reformer Pilates class. I would say this is more easier to moderate intensity. I really just needed something that was going to give me a little bit more mental clarity. Cause at the end of the day, it's not really about how hard you work out. Only 10% of your results. Especially once you're at a fitness stage that I am at, diet is 90% of your results. So after that reformer Pilates class, I had dinner, which was homemade ceviche. It had corn, fish, cucumber, cilantro, red onion, rice crackers as well half green tea. And I did have this maple pecan ice cream that I get from target. Everyone loves Halo Top, but honestly the best low calorie ice cream I've ever had just tastes like real actual ice cream is the one from target. You guys know that I don't really track my calories, so I just make sure to eat real nutrient dense meals and nothing that is way too out of proportion. Portions. These are not that big of portions, so I know for a fact that I was definitely on a deficit. Yeah, let's see what comes today. This is day two and I'll do another video and I'll vlog today as well.",570000

This is Episode 2 of all the foods I had on rotation that didn't make me feel like I was on a diet but help me lose the most amount of weight when I had it on rotation. Today we're speaking on something that is not necessarily a meal, but a snack instead, and that is beef jerky. Because when you think about it, this is literally just protein. As someone who likes to eat for a pretty long time, I will say that if I finish the food very quickly, I just don't get satisfied sometimes. This being literally just protein and it takes a pretty long time to chew beef jerky makes this really good and it's pretty low calorie as well. I would just highly suggest you look at the back and look at which ones have a lot of sugar. Other than that, go ham on beef jerky because to me it's protein and it's low calorie. And that's all you really need to know. If you are feeling peckish but are really trying to stay on track, this is one of the most filling, high protein, low calorie foods you can have as a snack.

Now, I did do some modifications for this so that I can make it a little bit less calories, because as you guys know, these are meals worth of calories in these drinks. So here's what I did instead. I asked for non dairy vanilla sweet cream cone foam instead. I reduced two of the pecan syrups, and I added one sugar free vanilla syrup, and I also made this with almond milk instead. Now, I do know for a fact that this is around 200 to 230 calories instead of it being a whopping 400 calories, but we're gonna give it a try and see if this is CIVI approved. Hmm. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's good. It's really good. This, for some reason reminds me of the cookie butter latte from Dunkin. So, yeah, I might have to be getting this again. Honestly, though, I will say it is pretty sweet. So I could have reduced the pecan syrup to only one instead of two. Yeah, honestly, nine out of 10, I would just reduce the sweetness just by a little bit more.",570000

Her hard work shows and she looks absolutely amazing but let's be real, most people are not gonna look at that exact body and be like, oh yeah, all she does is pilates. It's very clear that heavy lifting is behind this. I say this as a Pilates instructor and who used to be a former gym rat. I'm almost done with my Nassim certification as well, although like I said, she looks absolutely amazing and a lot of people want that kind of body. I personally don't want that body and I know there's other people out there who don't either. When I only chased heavy weights, yes, I built a lot of muscle, I got stronger, but I also had really bad knees, hence those knee sleeves in the video. I have not used a knee sleeve and I don't know when because it was just too much pressure on my knees. My body was a little bit more in that stress mode more often when I was heavy lifting way too many times a week and I'm going to be real, I was a lot more sexualized. I just despise feeling that way. There are a lot of women out there who also feel the same. So that's where I found Pilates to reduce my stress, also reduce my appetite, it heals my joints. I don't have any joint issues anymore. Again, heavy lifting has its perks, but At the end of the day, this is not a Pilates versus gym strength training kind of war. The truth is two together will give you results and give you benefits that only one of them won't do. I don't think it's right to be dismissing Pilates, especially if you've never studied or practiced it long enough, telling you right now getting the best of both worlds is the best thing for you if you want to start your strength and Pilates journey. I have a workout program that literally just came out today. Other than that, I hope this video is helpful.",570000

I've gotten several comments of people asking me is this worth it? So we're gonna go over the unboxing and everything you can do with this reformer if it is worth it. It's super compact, super easy to set up, and the design is minimal so it doesn't take over your space. And you can do all the reformer classics, planks, leg presses, core burners without needing a giant machine, which I found pretty impressive. Feel super smooth and super controlled. And it has kind of these like resistant band rubber band kind of things inside of the machine, so it does have the same feeling as a spring. So if you've always wanted to try Pilates on the reformer, but it's way too expensive, you cannot afford it, this is an amazing option to choose from. There are videos that you can watch to also do workouts with this. So if you want any workout videos using this thing, just let me know and I will make some for you guys.",570000

One of the first things that I do is actually set up all of my fridges, our main fridge and then my garage gym fridge. I like to put regular waters, sparkling waters, energy drinks ready to go, protein drinks. I then refilled our two coffee stations in the house, but lately been adding more tea in my life. I don't love it, but apparently my uterus loves it. If my doctors watching this, I hope you're happy. You're welcome. Then I set up my vitamins. This is my current stack of vitamins that I'm using. I set up a month worth of vitamins at a time. Then I set up my IVF meds. I typically do this every two weeks or so out with the old and with the new. Now we do a little bit of meal prepping. Some chicken, super, super easy. Just a tiny bit of olive oil and then I use some Montreal chicken seasoning and some taco meat with 96 4 lean ground beef and it laid out all my vegetables. Cut up a shit ton of veggies, including beets. Also do not love beets as they taste like dirt. Now I hang up all my gym outfits and sets. This has changed my life. I've been doing it for years because it makes getting dressed for the gym So easy. Then I went and put together my iconic snack station in our bedroom. I get late night munchies. And if I make sure my snack station is just high protein snacks, I have better boundaries at just getting one little treat. And always make sure I have a grounds program I'm following. Workouts are great, but you should always be following a program. So right now I'm doing the discipline diaries and I chose the dumbbell only program, although there's also a gym 1 or body weight one dumbbell for me. I can do it the gym, I can do it at home and it's been one of my favorites. Last but not least, I always make sure I have a packed gym bag ready to go with all my essentials so I can be ready for anything. No excuses. I'm always ready. And that's a wrap.",535000

What everyone saw as so saturated, I saw a problem in a very saturated market. And so I made it my mission. I was like, I'm gonna make this. I'm gonna create this. It was a heavy investment, 55,000 fitness apps. That can be very scary sounding. I remember the day before it launched, you know, I put all this money into it and all this time and everything. And I remember the day before I had imposter syndrome. I was like, oh my gosh, what am I doing? Why did I think that this was the right moment to be doing this?

And I think that if you're a business owner and you want to share your personal brand, I think that's one of the most genuine things you can do is show up and be like, I'm scared, I'm nervous to share this, but I'm excited to take you guys along with me. I'm not pretending to be an expert if Anything they'll appreciate and know that like, oh, this person's not talking down to me. This person's not preaching to me.

It took me a while to believe that, but now I know it's true. The reality is, you don't get to choose who you fall in love with. And you don't get to choose who falls in love with you. It's this uncontrollable force that just happens. And when it does, it changes everything. You know they're your person when you can be tired together or bored together, but every moment is still full of the energy that's good for your soul. It's in those quiet moments, when nothing much is happening, that you realise how deeply connected you are. You look at each other and there's a comfort, a peace that you can't find anywhere else. And when you never want them to stop talking because hearing them makes the world not so quiet anymore, that's when you know they take care of your heart and everything about you that no one else would care to know. They see the parts of you that you try to hide, and they love you even more. There's not a single love that is perfect, but there are hundreds that are real. It's messy and beautiful and worth every single second. This is what love is. This is what it means to find your soulmate.",535000

He's the mastermind behind the whole operation. He's dark, mysterious, and a little terrifying. You're goddamn right. This character is a Judge Judy. She is strict. She's straight to the point. She's not here to play, and she will be saying, you will not be ovulating in my courtroom. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

But I was like, no. My boundary was like, I don't want to do that until it's my own app. Always had that in the back of my mind that I would do it one day, um, but I waited until I had the right team and the right moment to do that. So as soon as Buffy Collection I had built out and hired a good amount of people to help manage the company and do what we were doing, um, I took a baby step back and I called around to a lot of different engineers, companies and was telling you my ideas, and a lot of them were like, holy shit, haha. Like, that's a lot. You're basically wanting to create five apps and put it into one. This is so expensive. Um, that was hiccup number one. So that was a struggle is finding a developer who could build me everything that I wanted. And some red flags for me was when they gave me quotes that were really low. Like, they're like, oh, yeah, we can do all that for like $20,000. I was like, you're gonna build me an app for Android and apple and a website with all these features for $20,000? Red flag. I was like, absolutely not. So I was kind of shopping around for engineers and then there was one guy that reached out to me and it was about partnering on their app. And so I asked to talk to the CEO and I was like, can you guys help me create my own? And they're like, we don't normally do that. And I was like, well, I was like, I can either. I was like, I can either, um, do this on my own or you can partner with me. I was like, if I do it on my own, I'm competition, but if you do it with me, you get a cut from it. And so that was kind of my way into it. And he's like, alright, fine. So then he helped me find the team that I use now, as well as a co founder. Um, it's myself, Jeff and James as like the three founders of grounds. And I'm so grateful for them every day because I truly think that the app would have succeeded, I think, no matter what. But I think that if you have people who are very passionate and care just as much of about the brand as you, it's really hard to find.",535000

Like, I almost. I think I did drop the phone. I was just like, I don't think I've ever had so much anxiety in my life. And as soon as I answer, I just knew. I just knew. My doctor's, like, the sweetest person, but I just knew from the sound of her voice, I think that she. She's so sweet. It's like, I can tell, like, she hurts for the woman that she has to make these calls to. I listened to the call, and I was like, all right, this is where we're at. I just. I knew that I didn't make it, and it's really hard. And she just said, let's take a little break. So I definitely needed some time after that, I think just the back to back cycles, the back to back. I don't know if you call those failed IVFS or just no result IVFS. Um, I had some wine, and I took baths, and I worked out and got back to feeling like me again, which I missed. And that's where I'm at now. Actually, this is probably my last day of feeling like me for a bit. And it felt good. Feel good to go back to being me, which is. It just felt good to be back to myself, I think. Took a few weeks off, went back into the doctor, and I was like, all right, I'm ready. Let's start. Let's start Cycle number three, right? I go get checked out, and I have a cyst on one ovary, the other ovary, there's no eggs. And then my right ovary had one follicle, and then a big old cyst squishing the follicle. I was like, oh, my god. So we did a trigger shot to try to squash the cyst that I had. And cysts are very normal, apparently. I've never had a cyst before. I've had so many scans and doctor's appointments, and they've never found a cyst. They're like, no, it's completely normal. Some women get them during periods. Totally cool. So, yeah, I had a cyst, and it was like, 19 millimeters or something, which is like, like the same size of, like, a good quality egg is what you want. So when I got home, did a trigger shot, went in four days later, and they were like, yep, still there. All right, we're gonna give it some more time. And so it's been a couple weeks now. I went in today, and the other cyst went away. Now there's a new one popping up, and I was like, oh, my god. So, yeah, I've had two cysts back to back. It could just be from, like, back to back IVF, cycles, hormones, all the things, but I've had two cysts on my one ovary. Um, and so if I take the medication right now, like, IVF medication is just going to make that cyst grow, because it's An estrogen producing follicle, I think is what it's called. So now the plan is to take ganirelix for seven days in a row to try to squash the cyst, and hopefully in a week I'll be able to start my third cycle. But right now, we're just kind of like, waiting on the cyst.",535000

They pulled it out, and the next day, they called me. They called me, and they said the egg fertilized. Man, that was a good feeling. I was so excited. So excited. I really thought, this is it. We did it. This is progress. This is better results than the cycle one. I remember I was so excited that Christian was in a meeting. It was a casual meeting. Like, nothing crazy. Honestly, we're probably just bullshitting. It was him and the guys, and I was like, oh, my god. Meet me outside in the hallway. I was just jumping up and down. I was just so, so excited to just tell him, like, the eight fertilized. So, gosh, I just. I just remember being so happy. But then the time after that is so hard because you have to wait. And again, that's the worst part. It's just waiting. And I knew that every day that went by was a lower and lower chance of it turning into a blastocyst. So you have an egg, it fertilizes, but the fertilization has to start replicating cells. With each day that's going by, they said, we'll call you maybe in a few days, maybe in a week. So each day that went by, I knew there was a less and less chance of the egg turning into a blastocyst, which is essentially an embryo ready to implant. So on the seventh, Day you get a call",535000

How to set up the Smith machine. I know it looks scary, but I promise it's not that scary. We're gonna call her Mrs. Smith. And when you walk up, there might be a bench in front of it. If you wanna get it out of the way, bend the knees, you're gonna pull it on up and the wheels on it will make it easy to get it out of the way. When you approach a Smith machine, there's hooks that go into it. So you're gonna pull up and you're either gonna pull outwards or you're gonna go inwards, depending on where the hook is. And this is gonna allow you to move and hook the bar wherever you want, depending on like what you're training, right? So I'm gonna be doing squats. I'm gonna put it right here. I try to put it right below my shoulder. Now, who needs a gym buddy when you have this thing? Check this out. There are these guard rails, as I call them, bumper plates. And you can put these anywhere you want. This is going to allow you to be able to use the machine and have a spotter. When it comes to putting weight on the Smith machine, first thing that you wanna be aware of is most of them have, it's like 5 pounds. It's very light. There's, there's no weight to it, but there are some Smith machines that do have like a 35 pound retention on it. First thing I suggest is feeling it out. So coming over here, putting it on your back, maybe do a little warm up set. Then you'll kind of feel out how much weight you want to put on it. Now, these are organized from lightest weight to heaviest weight. Again, if you're feeling it out, you're beginner in the gym, maybe start with a 5 pound, maybe start with a 10 pound on each side. Really feel out the new machine, the new movements and how much weight you want to put on there.",535000

There's a lot to go over today, which is really exciting. We'll have Gabby take it away with going over all of the impressions, Instagram and discussing the wins. First, May 3rd through July 31st, we hit 59 million views in the last 90 days. The majority of these views are stories. Second is reels, third are static post Facebook. So in the last 90 days, 2 million views on Facebook. And I will say just congrats guys, cause Facebook kind of sucks with all the men. Show me your feet. What socks are you wearing? I'm like, why are you here? 12% are women, 89% are men. It did increase. The men. The men increased. Yes, they increased. So we were posting two times a day every single day. We were over posting a bit. Going back to three times a week with shorts has done amazing. And we also are a lot more consistent with our long form videos too. That mixing with long form has done really well. I think top views on TikTok in the last 90 days is 75 million views. Oh yeah, 1.1 million people have viewed her profile. She's has 10 million likes and 1.6 million shares. Let's talk about what's working. Scarlett. So she came into our lives and she made me money. She goes and picks up Scarlett. She's like, hello, my little Money maker No. 2 on that category is Christian. Christian will, hopefully. Let's go, man. Let's go. Total collective views across all platforms are 143.5 million in 90 days. In 90 days, Times Square gets about 50 million visitors per year. That's nearly three times the annual foot traffic of Times Square. The Eiffel Tower welcomes about 7 million visitors annually. You've got 20 times more views than people who visit the Eiffel Tower each year. Disney World has 58 million visitors in 2022. Our views are almost 2.5 times that. Let's go, guys.",535000

No, get down. Get down. You're literally a troublemaker. Their personalities have been completely opposite. I don't know if anyone else has cats and their cats have completely different personalities. But Simba is very skittish and very much Scarlett is not afraid of anything. And that's the problem. She's not afraid of the robot litter box. She's not afraid of people. She's not afraid of animals. So it's been interesting having their personalities smashed together. Um, but it's been so much fun. Christian and I were never cat people before cause we just didn't really have cats. And it's just been so fun having both of them were like, our only regret is not getting cats sooner cause they just, they're So fun. They make us laugh. But, uh, yeah, let me know what questions you guys have, if any down below. Um, any questions about the cats? I'm sure a lot of you guys know their stories. Simba we found during a Hurricane last year, brought him home. Wanted to get Simba friends. We adopted Scarlett and she has been a menace. A menace. Yeah. Miss you guys.

So you better be nice. This is Nala. She is a 12 year old Siberian Husky. I know you can't tell. She really hates to be picked up. And when I was looking at getting a dog, they said huskies would be like, really hard to maintain cause they're like, super destructive and just all over the place. But she's really never chew to think she's really a fantastic dog. This right here is Simba. He is about one years old. We actually. I found him on the highway, uh, right after Hurricane barrel here in Houston. We had no power and I saw this little kitten cross the highway and I pulled over and happened to catch him. He did scratch me up pretty bad. And it sucks that his tail was actually, like, ran over by a tire, so we had to cut it off. But he is the coolest cat and super loving. Let's you hold him. It's pretty awesome. He kind of maybe wanted to. We kind of needed to get him a friend. So I'm gonna show you Scarlett. Last but not least, we have Scarlett. She is between 4 and five months old. And she looks cute now, but she is chaos and totally opposite of Simba. Um, super energetic, doesn't let me sleep. But yeah, she's pretty cool. And they're finally like, actually hanging out together and, uh, like playing So that was the whole goal of getting her. But her backstory, her mom was dropped off at the animal hospital, just in a box, and she's one of the kittens. The mom is pregnant, and then she's one of the kittens that that mom had. So Lake Olympia has a lot of kittens up for adoption, like her brothers and sisters right now. So you should go check them out. Say something nice.",535000

So I have my blood game changer backpack from Buff Bunny Collection that's actually on sale right now. But there's actually a cooler that's collapsible in here, so if you guys are an IVF, I feel like this will actually come in handy. Um, but I'm taking three vials of menopur, 2:25 of the gonal shots, and then they just added this letrozole to see if my ovaries stimulate more while taking this. Lastly, I just got. This is a supplement, but I just got it in the mail, so, um, I'm gonna be taking it the first time today. I will say, though, that this hormone or whatever this is, um, I feel like I'm having a little bit of a reaction on the back of my arms from it. So I'm still gonna take it today, but definitely having some flare UPS from my keratosis pilaris or whatever it's called. So all the hormones, you know. Okay, you ready? Always. Haha.

The case for example I get up I can on my salt at 1st o'clock get up I do my little stretching I read my book it carries my day so well but also I try to be less salt towards myself then tell myself if I don't do my morning routine it doesn't matter I will still have 1 beautiful day.",85000

She had the A frame belly button, no progress pictures. Got em. Does she actually have hamstrings? Yes, and she sent me these pictures right before I made this video. She made it a point to be as transparent as possible because she wanted to let everyone know that she had nothing to hide. She agreed to come on as one of my clients for the next 3 months.

We are here with Bambiana. I get tagged in her videos almost on an hourly basis. Guys, one of the biggest things is that if you don't have hip dips, it's definitely fake. That's not the case if you have hip dips or you don't, it's a genetic factor. You can have them or you cannot. In her case, you can see she works on her quad sweep, where she does have hip dips here, but because of the work in the tissue that she's added, it hides then some of the famous poses. You'll see when we pop the hip out here, you'll see how it will hide any hip dip if you have them. So this is definitely a real booty. BBL or not? Not.

Person A and a clone of person A. Person A diets and trains consistently for 3 months. The clone doesn't train at all. Person A and the clones stop for 3 more months. Then they both diet and train consistently for 3 months. Person A is gonna see more results than the clone. Out of 9 months, person A trained for 6 of them. The clone only trained for 3. When you've been training and dieting consistently and all of a sudden life happens and you're not able to, your body still has muscle memory so it's easier for you to bounce back. Going through a process you've already gone through before is always going to be easier than starting a process from ground 0.",99500

It works really well. And then I download it to my computer, and then I airdrop it back to my iPhone, and then I upload it onto whatever platform I'm using. It's like, why is there 97 steps? Am I overworking? Am I overthinking this? Is anybody else using 97 apps as well? Is this how we're doing it? Like, this is exhausting. Just kidding, I enjoy it.",40700

I literally wore these throughout the entire pregnancy. They fit in the first, second, and third trimester. Do not snooze on the maternity pillow. It is life changing, especially as the belly gets bigger. I like this one cause it's half size versus being all the way around because there's only so much room in the bed. So I didn't buy this exact one, but this is one change that I would make. I would buy a long shoehorn, which I have two of them. The only thing I'm missing is the short shoehorn because it would be nice to throw it in my purse whenever I take my shoes off. Pretty much everywhere else that I go.

For starters, skip the chest breathing. It is so not effective. By the way, belly hugs or 3 60 breathing will aid in a quicker recovery, easier labor, and not to mention helps you move better with fewer pains during pregnancy. How to do it inhale into the belly, the sides of the ribs, and the back of the ribs expanding in all directions aka 360 degrees. Exhale slowly like you're blowing out a birthday candle. The belly should hug in and up and the navel should move towards the spine. This type of breathing utilizes the diaphragm and not the chest. Keep it breezy and beneficial.",40700

Beginning with symptoms, I would say that weeks 8 and 9 were the worst for me when it came down to pregnancy symptoms. I started to experience nausea around weeks seven or eightish, but it would usually go away around 4 p m. In the afternoon. And then one of my doctors told me about the amazing unisome and the six combo, and I took that for a few weeks throughout the tough parts of the first trimester, and I have to tell you, that saved me. I dealt a lot with insomnia in the first trimester. I'm still dealing with it. I get up at 3 or 4 a m. And then I can't fall back asleep until 6 or 7 a m. That's brutal. Food aversions. There is one silly little food that I just did not want anything to do with, and that was coffee. Which is crazy because I am such a coffee queen. I would have multiple throughout the day, and then around we ate, I just didn't want anything to do with coffee. I did had two major food cravings, and these cravings were consisted. I wanted them every day, and those were Honeycrisp apples and orange juice. All in all, I would say that the first trimester was pretty mild for me, but I was very consistent with my workouts. On the days I was working out, I would make sure that I got my 10K steps. I was good about hydrating and I was getting enough protein, and I feel like that really helped me power through, making sure that had enough energy and that I was able to keep moving. I'm gonna do one of those videos where you do the old wives tales about gender prediction, and this is the final look.",40700

That I would get so lightheaded doing these. So the y in fitness, we call these level changes. And during pregnancy, especially early on, there's an increase in heart rate and increase blood flow combined with a decrease in blood pressure. So if you or your client are pregnant, be mindful of these cardiovascular changes that may be limit the number of level changes that you do, or at least modify them.

But we also get to play gym runs so smooth because everybody cleans up after themselves, including us. We also got some exposure to NFL Combine training programs, and I've got to give a major shout out to Giovanni, who has been dropping knowledge on us all week long. Getting to play around in the gym has been such a fun team building exercise, and I also can't wait to bring the stuff back to York City with me.

Anyway, here's what I Learned. Apparently I've been rolling my lats wrong all along on the foam roller. This was killer. Picked up some awesome new kettlebell mobility and stability exercises to help with shoulder and thoracic. Fine stuff. Learned some new ways to do the greatest stretch in the world. You'll definitely see this in my upcoming classes and sessions. Same with the boring all inchworm. I Learned a new way to make it fun and functional. And apparently I've been doing butt kicks wrong my whole life. And I Learned the proper way to do them, which I might add requires a lot more brain stimulation. We work on absolute speed, and as I watch this video, I absolutely need to get into a higher gear for lunch. I took a 13 minute power nap in the massage room, which was awesome. Great call! And then we hit the weight room after lunch and Learned some awesome variations to the classic exercises. Single arm rose landmine presses. A reverse in this case. And then we ended the day on a fun way to actively rest during some cardio sessions using a lot more brain activity. Anyway, that was day three. Tomorrow is day four and they will be the last day of phase one. And then I have phase 2 next week. Okay, see you later! Bye bye!",40700

Day two at the EXOS Performance Mentorship in Phoenix, Arizona. Start time was 8:45 a. M. Ish today and we jumped right into movement. We started with some movement prep, some core activation, some warm up drills, Learned some new tricks on the Kaiser machine, then we went outside for about two hours. By the way, it was 100 degrees and we worked on acceleration and med ball drills. It was hot, but it definitely made the first half the day go by quick. And after two hours of workout work, we went in for a quick 30 minute lecture before heading to lunch. Lunch Slade again today. It was so yummy! I was also so sweaty for the morning session that I decided to take a shower. That was definitely one of the best decisions I made all day, besides packing the cookies. After lunch we did about 90 minutes of lecture, and then we went back into the gym for about 90 minutes or two hours of work on some strength principles. We also got to watch one of the EXOS coaches during his session with a high school basketball team, which was very cool to watch. Then we ended on some versa climber power drills before I blocked out. Just kidding. We called it at 8 5 PM, so I will see you tomorrow for day 3!",40700

I'll be honest, I didn't really know what to expect cause there's not a whole lot of information on what exactly this mentorship entails, and only two my trainer friends have ever taken this course. If you do plan on taking certification, I highly recommend renting a car. It was actually in this moment that I realized my Airbnb was 20 miles away from EXOS, but in Phoenix. Driving that ended up being about 30 minutes. So call time was 8:00am, and after a quick intro, we toured the facilities and did about three hours of lecturing. Broke for lunch. EXOS provided lunch, which was pretty great, and then we had some time to run around after before heading into another about 90 minutes of lecture, and then we spent the rest of the day practicing all the content we had Learned about earlier today. Specifically, we worked on movement prep and supply of metrics. Anyway, that's day one, and I'll see you for day two tomorrow.",40700

The only 2 jobs that I've ever had have been at restaurants and in fitness gyms. And if you're curious, I worked at chili's PF Chang in California. Pizza Kitchen. Let's begin. So I have to start with my wet ingredients first, which is the milk. You can use whatever nut milk you want. One and 1/2 cups. And then I actually add the protein to the milk. I don't have a favorite protein. We're using whatever my husband had, which in this case is the ghost cereal milk flavor protein. If you are making this, I recommend having a vanilla protein, or you can put whatever flavor you want. I'm gonna do 2 scoop 1 2. Just mix it together with my little whisk. Okay, so now we are going to put our oats in. I use one and 1/2 cups of rolled oats, 1 2 3, and then I do 3 tablespoons of chia seed. There's what we have so far. And then I usually add a cup of yogurt. I don't know. I get 2 of these, and you can do whatever flavor you want. I did find that the best flavor is vanilla, though. But today I'm gonna use strawberry, because I'm trying to use what we have, then add them in, mix it up so it looks a little something like this. And now I'm going to add in my protein mix. And once everything Is added all together. This usually gives me 5 to 6 servings. Chris and I split it so it lasts 2 to 3. Morning. Just mix, mix, mix. So it's pretty watery. I'm just gonna add in some more oats. And in the morning I usually add a little bit more milk just to make it a little bit more soupy. Cause usually after these have stayed overnight, the oats and the chia seeds soak up all the moisture so it's kind of chunky. So I like to add in some extra milk in the morning anyway. That's it. Does not take that long. Cut up some fresh fruit. In the morning. I like to add slivered almonds on top as it gives it a nice little crunch. That is it. That is Charlie. Overnight oats.",40700

I'm gonna list all the apps and the equipment that I use. I use a platform called splicer to find locations around New York City to film where you can rent by the hour. I use this Sony camera and lens setup plus a larger monitor so that I can see myself while I'm filming. After I film, I send the raw files over to my video editor, Jen, who adds in extra size timers and buzzers when she returns it to me. I use Canva to create a gradient image with text that has exercised titles on it. And then from there I release a new fitness challenge every month and a brand new video every week on LOS Wet TV.

The Laswat ABS Challenge is my most popular fitness challenge. It's what I used to launch my workout app back in 2020. And to this day, it's still the top challenge that brings the most amount of new people to my app. But in even better news, I am launching a brand new ABS challenge tomorrow.

Shifting these gears and what this clutch feels like. How can you describe that? Well, pretty much as you get ready to tack it up, you'll bring in some power. It depends on where you're at. Drop the clutch in first, get it tacked up, you'll feel it start to drop off on you. You'll go for second. And what's nice is when you go for third, you just push. You can see how the shifter pushes already into third, right like that? Yeah. So unlike a gated shifter, we have to go 1, two and actually force it into third, fourth. This, actually, you just go straight up and brings it right back. So you can actually really speed shift that guitar gears through it. That way, this will get away from you real quick. I like it.

Instead of doing side raises where you come all the way down to your side and then come up like this, which are still great. I'm not knocking those. Let's not argue about that. The reason why I call them a dragonfly is it kind of emulates the path of a dragonfly's wings. So they don't come all the way down. They stop about here and we come up to about here. So there's constant tension. My wrist is strong, meaning it's not limping over like that. I keep a strong wrist. I keep the tension in the shoulders. The chest stays up and we're controlling that weight under constant tension. You can see I've done like seven reps, eight reps, my shoulders are already getting going here.

The bar flew up in the air, other weight fell on the ground. It was at like prime time, 5:30, 6:00 o'clock at night. The whole gym stopped and looked at me. My ego was hurt so much that I was embarrassed to go back to the gym and I started working out my room instead. And what I did was push UPS. I started getting to the point where I could get hundreds of push UPS and then I felt ready to go back to the gym. So if you fall somewhat in that category of just feeling like I'm not ready to go into a gym setting yet, but I want to do something on my own, a push up is a great body weight exercise. You could even start from your knees if you have to and then go to structured form. Push up.",24500

But what I realized was over time, with that perfect form and controlling the weight, I started seeing better results. I started getting stronger again cause I'd hit a plateau. Like that ego lifting in the beginning, especially if you're new to working out, it's a high risk, but you will get results. It's just that then you'll end up hitting a plateau. And so I was able to break that plateau by actually being willing to take a few steps back, using that proper form and controlling the weight. I was then able to surpass where I was at and hitting that plateau. If your form starts to break down, check the ego, use lighter weight that you can control.

That's, that's what they're originally built to drive and that's what we do with them. And we've got a Hellcat engine dropped in here. Correct. We did an upgraded pulley on this Which gave us about another 80 to 100 horsepower. So going from the stock 6.2 liter Hellcat engine, basically integrated it up to what would you basically call the Hellcat red eye. You've exhaust on that? Of course we do. Uh, fabricator American Legends had a custom, uh, stainless steel exhaust on it. Very meticulous on all their lines, the fabrication, everything else that they did on the car.

If you're trying to build strength, then that's where the super low volume reps with max weight is going to come into play. A lot of people think that when you're trying to put on a lot of size or you're bulking, you're going to do super low reps with a lot of weight. That's how you build strength. The way we want to build size and muscle mass is through hypertrophy. So I want to be strong and build muscle mass. So I still mix in some of those low rep ranges with max weight. But whether you're picking 10 or 20 reps, what I need you to do pick weight that is going to challenge you through that rep range. If you pick up a weight and you do 10 reps with it, and at your 10th rep, you had 10 more in the tank, you use too light a weight. I want you to use perfect form. And if your form starts to break down because you've picked too heavy of weight, you need to check your ego, and you need to go down in weight and maintain that perfect form. The proper range of motion is also going to be a major factor. Studies actually show a lot of the muscle stimulus is in the stretch portion, even though the contraction feels like that's where the majority Of the works being done, it's actually the majority. In the stretch, I want you to pick weight that you can control, but it's really gonna challenge you.",24500

In this episode of what I've Learned, I shared how courage brought me to the edge, but it was clarity that helped me take the leap. Hey, my name is Jean and I'm sure 90% of you who are watching this video thought about quitting your corporate job. To be Frank, I remember feeling constantly very drained and no matter how much rest I got, I still wake up feeling very tired. I thought perhaps I need a change of environment. So I went to another company to maybe bring that, but that did not last very long because one year later, I resigned. So here are some of the questions that I asked myself. Why did I want to leave? Was I running away from something or stepping towards something better? For me, it was about creating space to explore, to grow, to stop living on autopilot mode. But what about your financial situation? These are just a few things that I had to consider before I was leaving. For instance, rent. You have to ask yourself, how much rent are you paying for right now? Personally, I wouldn't leave unless I have about 3 to 6 months of caution for rent. Next, groceries. This might vary a lot depending on where you live and how you eat. Some questions you can ask yourself would be, what's your monthly grocery spend? And are you able to meal prep to cut costs? Followed By insurance, health insurance and travel insurance are very important as well. Other things that you might have to consider includes phone bills, utilities. And as for investment, are you going to continue investing or are you going to give it a pause and other little buffer of joy that you want in your life? In the next episode, I'll share where this leap has taken me and what this journey has taught me so far. So be sure to follow along and remember, stay curious.",47600

Just climb the corporate ladder, they say, and by the age of 35, you are set for life. But at what cost? And when you're ready to throw that resignation letter, you start asking yourself, but what about my stable income? What would people think? The bonus is good, though? Should I just stay a bit longer? The reality is there's never going to be the right time to quit, and so I left. And that's what courage looks like, showing up for yourself, stepping out of your comfort zone, and even without a clear plan. But now comes the question, how do I sustain myself? In the next episode, I'll be sharing how I prepare myself both mentally and financially. And if that's what you're wondering, too, be sure to follow along. And with that, stay curious.",47600

To start us off, this is one part of the gym where you have your squat racks, your dumbbells, as well as your bench. Just moving on, some of the machines that they have includes lat pull down, RDL, hip thrust, shoulder press, all you can think of. If you are into Crossfit and High Ropes, they got you covered as well. They also have a recovery room, which I thought it was pretty cool.

You must try this chocolate protein ice cream that I have created. It is made by Ninja Creamy. Look at all the seven preset programmes it has. Today I'm going to try and make ice cream. It has been so long since I had one. Step one, I'm going to add some chocolate protein powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, some banana, Greek yogurt, not a fan of yogurt, but hopefully the ice cream still tastes good. Lactose free milk since I'm lactose intolerant. Peanut butter, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt and my base is complete. Step two, I'm gonna freeze it 24 hours and we shall see how it is the next morning. Step three, I'm gonna creamify my base. Creamy's powerful paddle shaves everything you crave into creamy treats. I'm so excited to taste my ice cream. Not going to lie, this is life changing. I get to enjoy a high protein ice cream for dessert without feeling the guilt of indulging. If you're sick and tired of worrying about your calories and protein intake, you should definitely check this out.",47600

So today we are at the Bumble Urban Mellows event. Super excited and slightly nervous to be here. And yes, I have finally joined a run club. Besides weightlifting, running has always been my thing, but running with a group is so fun as well. It's really cool that you get to meet people who share a similar hobby as you. In this type of event, you want to be more intentional in approaching people and make conversation. As for me, I met so many diverse people and some of them even wait live the exchange social media and now I can't wait to see them again in the next run. Overall, it was such an interesting experience to get off my comfort zone and intentionally make connections in my interest space. So yeah, I'll see you guys in the next run.",47600

Hi, everyone. I personally love getting my gifts from UA and under armour has reopened their new store at Ultra Central. So let's check it out. The store is 1.5 times bigger than before and now there's two section, male and female, so you can easily explore it. And I saw that the recently launched Sports Style collection is available and I love how it's got these street wear vibes and it's super stylish. I really love the sports bra that I'm wearing right now and these track pants. And there's so many variety for you to choose from. If you're ever looking for a pump cover or compression tee, you can check these out. Anyways, if you're around Orchard Central, the store has just opened, so be sure to hit down.",47600

I finished prepping my skin and yeah, it's time for me to like hit the bed and I'll catch you all later and see if my face has any changes. This is the next morning.

First things first, this sounds like such a simple little thing, but drinking your water does make a huge difference. Our muscles are made up of 75% of water. If you want that plump, juicy, a nice look, drink your water. It also helps with bloideness and it's gonna give you a radiant skin. Stop going to the gym without a plan. Stop going to the gym and doing whatever exercise you feel like doing or whatever machine is available. Go with a structured routine because otherwise you will just have whatever results or no results whatsoever. Because although you can freestyle a bunch of different things in life, you cannot freestyle your way into seeing results at the gym. I'm not even gonna go in circles about this. Eat your protein and prioritize your nutrition. Otherwise you won't see results. Stop skipping your cardio. I know a lot of people who just want to grow muscle. They just want a juicy fat ass. They don't wanna do cardio. I was guilty of this. Trust me when I tell you, if you're doing your cardio, you're gonna grow nice muscles and you will also be looking lean AF.",99300

I was not taught how to say I'm not okay. And things like mental illness or sadness, they often get brushed off as white people problems. So when I became a content creator, I realized I was always showing up online with a mask with fear, scared of putting my business out there and being. And because of that, one of my New Year's resolution was actually to be more vulnerable to change that around here. But in case you didn't notice, it's already September, which means that, yeah, yeah, I really post phone starting. Hi, my name is Vanessa. I'm Muslim vegan and my parents mean the world to me. My dad passed away in 2017, but I like to think that a piece of him lives in everything. I moved to Portugal alone for college and in my first year, I couldn't make a single friend. And eventually I did make a Portuguese friend on my second year, but she barely counts because she lives on the African side of TikTok and she understands my African joke and that takes away the whole point of having a Portuguese. Somewhere along the way, I also developed a severe skin condition. The doctor says due to stress. And unfortunately, this is much more than just skin deep. It touches my confidence, my day to day and the way I see myself. And by telling you this, I'm hoping that Maybe, just maybe, my story reminds you that you're not alone either.",99300

You can drink all the lemon water in the world that you want. You can drink anything and everything on the planet earth to lose weight. You are not going to lose weight if you're not in a deficit. Cause at the end of the day, the ultimate dictator whether you're going to lose weight or you're not will be if you're spending more calories than what you're consuming. And with that, my favorite point, which I will continue preaching this until the day I die, the moment you start prioritizing your nutrition, you're going to see the most results you've ever seen in your journey. As someone that was training for years, I was lifting my heaviest, I was the most consistent. I did think I could overlook my nutrition and I didn't see results for so many years. If you don't wanna go on the same path as me and wait 7 to 8 years until you see results, start prioritizing your nutrition. I don't have the money to buy supplements. You can see so much results without taking any supplements at the time. I'm not taking any supplements and I'm doing just fine. The amount of sweat you have during your workout is not a direct reflection on how much calories you're burning. Same way if you're not sore the next Day doesn't mean the workout was not a good workout. You can still have an amazing workout and still see amazing results and not be sore the next day.",99300

Like around a year ago, I got the information that I had to move out of the apartment that I was staying at, that I literally didn't pay anything. I started thinking to myself, I don't have the money to go to a new apartment. I don't have the money to pay rent. Apartments in Lisbon are expensive for minimum wage, which is what I was making. I had two options. Either I would have to rent out a room, a very cheap one, because rooms are also expensive in Lisbon. Either I would have to figure this thing out, I would have to make more money. But I literally had three months to move out of the apartment that I was at. And I was like, I don't know where to get money from. For a few years, I was trying to create content. But you know, when you're trying to create content, but you're trying to make it seem like you're not trying too hard. Like if a video goes viral, amazing. But then if it doesn't, it's also like, I'm not trying too hard. That's what I was doing. I would post every once in a while. I would try to seem it as effortless as possible. That predicament, I was like, I don't have any other choice than to actually try my best with this. And like actually be consistent and have a strategy behind it. And that's exactly what I did. I started posting very intentionally. I started being very consistent with my content and every single day I was being consistent. I did a glute guide and I put it in my bio. And then after the first month, nothing is happening. Second month of being fully consistent, nothing is going on. Third one is approaching and I'm like, you know, just like, I'm just gonna stop with this whole social media situation. Like it's not working out. Let me actually go look for a second job. So I went to an interview to become a babysitter. And on that day, I promised myself that when I get out of this interview, like I'm not gonna post again. Like this is not working out. I was just wasting my time and just like, what's the point, right? Maybe like it wasn't meant to be right? And then I go on this interview, I spent the whole day there because the lady was like, okay, let's try and see how you are with the kids like go give them bath and stuff. And the most, I'm sorry lady if you see this, but those kids were horrible. Like the, I have nightmares about those kids. So I spent the whole day there. My phone was off because I was in the interview and I was like, these kids are horrible, but I'm gonna have To put up with this and I'm gonna have to find a way to stay because they were paying really good. I'm just gonna stop with this whole social media thing. Cool. When I'm out of the interview, I go on my phone and I had a video that was going crazy viral, my first video that was going viral and I made 900 in sales in that day on my Google guide and I was like, what the hell? And yeah, from that point on my account started growing. That video was going viral. Other videos that I was posting and being consistent started going viral as well and I do content creation full time now. I have my own coaching business. I make much much more than I was gonna make on my 9 to 5 and on that babysitter job together. Life has been great. I've been working with brands that I love. I've been approached by brands that I've always wanted to work with since people are like, oh, this thing didn't work out. Maybe you had like two days left for it to work out. That video didn't go viral that day and it was supposed to go viral the next day. I would never know because I didn't wait until it was working.",99300

As you guys can see, I am a fitness content creator. I live in Portugal, but I am Mozambican. And for years I tried to get into the content creation scene here in Portugal. I was really trying to grow my account, work with brands. And when I tell you for years, no brand wanted to work with me like ever. And after three months of constantly switching out my content for international content, I managed to go from working a 9 to 5 into doing content creation full time. And all of the brands that I never even thought it was possible for me to work with them approached me in a matter of three months. Those who knows the Portuguese content creation scene, it is very peculiar. It has a specific type of people who are able to make it and it's usually not people like myself. So the fact that I was putting so much into a place that literally wasn't appreciating me, after only three months of trying to reach the international audience, I was able to do much more than what I used to do on my 9 to 5. I'm able to do content creation full time. I'm a coaching. I have my own coaching app now. And it's just like my life changed in the matter of three months just because I decided to insert myself. In a different environment speaks volumes sometimes if you know you're doing your best, you're putting in the work, you know your content is amazing and you're not being appreciated.

If you're always having protein chips, protein yogurts, protein, everything at that, and have real protein, because all these protein products are in the market have so many additives, so many conservatives and so many things that are disrupting your gut and making you more bloated. Second thing that I do is adding some type of fermented food into every meal that I have. If I'm having some breakfast, I might put some kimchi. Having some lunch or some dinner, I might add some miso or drinking it with some kombucha. If you're a person that can drink kefir, that's also a great addition. Getting that good bacteria into your gut will help so much with your bloating. Contrary to popular belief, because I don't know who told people that if you drink more water, you're gonna get more bloated. You should be drinking the amount of water your body needs every single day, because instead of getting you more bloated, as a lot of people think, it will actually help with water retention, making you less bloated.",99300

Watching all other seasons of Love Island was actually something that was entertaining. It was something good. And now when I watch this season, it's like I need to go touch grass. When I go on TikTok and I see videos, I need to go and touch grass. Although I understand reality t. V, we need drama and stuff. It's just like this one is just like getting out of hand because from what I see is just a bunch of people with not very good intentions, but they just look better depending on who they're next to. There has been so many instances of people doing wrong in the show and doing something that is not morally correct and someone does something worse and all of a sudden, it's like this person is in the good because this person is doing something worse. Because someone is doing something worse, it doesn't automatically make you a good person. And this is the type of discernment that I feel like the viewers don't have. Cause then the viewers like to play favourites because when their favourite islander does something shady or something wrong, they excuse it. But when someone else does the exact same thing or even not as bad, all of a sudden is a big issue. The same thing happens with the Islanders, when they do something that is not morally correct, it's okay. But when someone else does, it is all of a sudden is the biggest deal in the world. So the real question that we should ask ourselves as a collective is, why are we so quick to excuse bad behaviour just because we don't like the alternative?",99300

There's plenty of different areas in life that you can be spontaneous. The gym is not one of them. Lift very heavy. Trust me, I've had my fair share of lifting very heavy for a few years. If your goal is to increase strength, that's okay. I still do progressive overload. I still lift a little bit heavy, but I just don't lift super heavy like I used to before. I don't skip cardio. So many people like to skip cardio. I was one of those people. And I don't do cardio as a warm up. I will do dynamic stretches as a warm up and I will do cardio post workout. Cause a lot of people do 30 minutes in the treadmill and then go lift some weights. By the time you finish your cardio, you're already tired to do the strength training. So after every single workout, you will catch me at the treadmill, at the bike, rowing, Stairmaster sometimes. I don't neglect my nutrition and my sleep. Those are two things I don't play about.

For me, the answer was a lot. I'd stay quiet when I wanted to speak up, scared. I would say something stupid, avoid people I wanted to connect with and talk myself out of things that I've actually wanted to do. That's why one of my New Year's resolution was to stop letting anxiety steal those moments away from me. And that implies start practicing small daily habits to build up my confidence. Everyday, I give myself a simple task that doesn't feel overwhelming. And today's was make eye contact with myself in the mirror for 30 seconds, say hello out loud five times and finish with a smile. These are things that seem so small, but they end up compounding. And everyday I'm much more confident showing up as myself.",99300

Often times we end up procrastinating because we want to do everything so perfect. Like we want to do a full one hour workout and do it perfectly. And just the thought of that, it leads up to not doing anything. But doing something, even if it's tiny, it's better than doing nothing. Follow the 10 minute rule. If you don't feel like doing a one hour workout, just do 10 minutes of a body weight circuit. If you don't feel like meal prepping, ingredient prep, or just chop some vegetables, chop some fruit, whatever it is, action will eventually create momentum.",99300

But the thing is, the real discipline is making a habit so small and repeatable that you don't even think about it. You barely think about it. Like when I go to the gym, when I go for a walk, when I eat healthy, I'm barely thinking about it. Like it just naturally happens. So if you're aiming to become a more disciplined person, start with very small habits. Don't start with going to the gym six times a week. Start with three. Or even be more realistic too. Don't do long sessions. Do that 30 minute session or even less. Whatever you think it's bearable for you right now, do that. Instead of saying I'm going to start eating 100% healthy, start with aiming for two healthy meals a day or one. And slowly but surely, before you even realize, you're going to become a more disciplined and healthier person. And it's not even going to be hard.",99300

Today was one of those days. So today we're doing bar, which is a low impact workout mixing ballet, Pilates and strength. And it's good to tone, strengthen and improve posture. Getting in the sink will send my Mozambique mom into a coma and it would send me too. But the thing is I didn't have any more time and I had to fill and be out of the house as soon as possible. So I had to put a little something in my stomach because I don't wanna faint guys. I think I fainted more times than I can count. And look how cute and cozy this space is. You even forget you're about to get tortured. Another thing that I really liked about this studio is like is a four four people class. So the instructor pays more attention to what each one of you are doing. Straight away when we started, she said, and we're done with the warm up. And I was like, this is the warm up which I was already mentally prepared because I watched so many TikToks about it. And I'm the type of person that will watch 100 TikToks before going to a place cause I don't like surprises. But all jokes aside, this class was Amazing. And I'm already booked for my next session. And then they gave me kombucha to make up all the physical and mental damages they did to me today. And because I actually did well in this cause regardless of how insanely hard it was, I decided to go treat myself to a permanent bracelet. I took a two hour walk from the studio up to Alex Factory in Liz I went to get this permanent bracelet that I've been seeing all over TikTok. Also ended up getting a cute little everyday necklace. As soon as I got home, I finished the meal that I didn't have the opportunity to do. So when I was getting ready, some coconut water, of course, because of all the dehydration your girl went through today. Cause I was sweating my ass off in that class. I don't even sweat that much. And some watermelon, of course.",99300

The first thing is transforming your mindset in order to upgrade your habits, because if you keep doing the same things, you will keep having the same outcome.",99300
